The genomic variant c.481+197G>A, also known as rs2860905, is located in the CYP2C9 gene. CYP2C9 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds, including drugs such as warfarin. The CYP2C9 enzyme is primarily found in the liver and is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of several clinically important drugs, playing a crucial role in drug pharmacokinetics and response.The rs2860905 variant has been studied in various populations and has shown associations with drug metabolism and disease risk. Specifically, this intronic variant has been implicated in warfarin sensitivity and resistance. In a study of Puerto Ricans, rs2860905 was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs within a 50 kb block and was associated with warfarin dose requirements. The variant was part of haplotypes that included either CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 alleles, which are known to affect warfarin metabolism. However, the presence of rs2860905 does not necessarily indicate the presence of these alleles, as indicated by an R^2 value of 0.35, suggesting that it captures the effects of both alleles in the association test [3].Moreover, rs2860905 has been associated with ischemic stroke risk in a Taiwanese population, where the GG genotype was found to enhance the risk of the disease [5]. This finding underscores the potential importance of considering genotype-specific contributors to ischemic stroke in clinical and experimental investigations.In terms of warfarin resistance, rs2860905 showed nominal significance with odds ratios (ORs) less than 1, suggesting that the A allele is more frequent among the sensitive group, while the G allele is more prevalent among the resistant group [3]. This variant has also been associated with warfarin sensitivity and resistance in other studies, further highlighting its potential role in pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine [4].In summary, the c.481+197G>A rs2860905 variant in the CYP2C9 gene is an intronic variant that has been associated with warfarin metabolism and ischemic stroke risk. Its presence in haplotypes that include other clinically relevant CYP2C9 alleles suggests that it may have a functional impact on drug metabolism and disease susceptibility, making it a potential target for further research and clinical consideration.
