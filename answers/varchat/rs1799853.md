The genomic variant c.430C>A p.Arg144Ser rs1799853 is located in the CYP2C9 gene, which encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, including drugs such as warfarin and diclofenac [3]. The CYP2C9 enzyme plays a significant role in the activation and detoxification of many carcinogens, which are thought to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) [1].The rs1799853 variant has been studied in various populations to assess its association with CRC risk. A meta-analysis including 9,463 cases and 11,416 controls did not support an association between the rs1799853 variant and CRC, suggesting that the screening utility of this genetic variant in asymptomatic individuals may not be warranted [1]. The variant's allele frequencies have been shown to differ between ethnic populations, which could contribute to the inconsistent results observed in different studies [1].In terms of drug metabolism, the rs1799853 variant has been implicated in altered drug responses. For example, a study reported a new allelic variant, CYP2C9*35, found in a warfarin hypersensitive patient, which included the Arg144Cys mutation. This mutation was shown to prevent productive interactions between CYP2C9 and cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), resulting in the absence of NADPH-dependent CYP2C9-catalyzed activity in vivo and influencing warfarin sensitivity [3].Additionally, the rs1799853 variant has been evaluated for its association with drug-resistant epilepsy in children. It was found that the presence of the T allele at this locus increases the risk of drug-resistance in patients with diagnosed epilepsy [5].Ethnic differences in the distribution of the rs1799853 variant have been reported, with the variant being rare in the Japanese population and showing different frequencies among various Jewish ethnic groups [6].In clinical genotyping assays, the presence of the rs1799853 variant can lead to ambiguous results, as demonstrated in a case where an ambiguous result was obtained during routine CYP2C9 genotyping. This highlights the importance of accurate genotyping methods to avoid inappropriate dose adjustments and potential adverse drug reactions [2].In summary, the c.430C>A p.Arg144Ser rs1799853 variant in the CYP2C9 gene does not appear to contribute significantly to CRC risk [1], but it may influence drug metabolism and the risk of drug-resistant epilepsy [3][5]. The variant exhibits ethnic variability in its distribution [6], and accurate genotyping is essential for appropriate clinical management [2]. ClinVar has one benign submission for this variant, indicating that it is not typically associated with severe clinical consequences.
