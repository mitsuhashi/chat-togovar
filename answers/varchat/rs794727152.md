The genomic variant c.2558G>A p.Arg853Gln, designated as rs794727152, is located on the SCN2A gene, which encodes the NaV1.2 voltage-gated sodium channel. This channel is predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons and plays a critical role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials, thus being essential for neuronal excitability and communication.The p.Arg853Gln variant has been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This missense variant results in the substitution of arginine to glutamine at position 853 of the NaV1.2 channel, which is a highly conserved amino acid residue within the helical repeat II region of the protein, suggesting its functional importance [2].Functional studies have demonstrated that the p.Arg853Gln variant leads to a loss-of-function effect on the NaV1.2 channel. Specifically, the variant has been shown to cause an overall reduction in channel function due to multiple defects in time- and voltage-dependent channel properties, including altered voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, slower recovery from inactivation, and decreased channel availability during high-frequency depolarizations [3]. A notable finding is the enhancement of slow inactivation conferred by the p.Arg853Gln mutation, which is a major driver of the loss-of-function phenotype and may explain the later onset of symptoms associated with this variant [3].Clinically, patients with the p.Arg853Gln variant typically present with infantile spasms after 6 months of age, which is consistent with the loss-of-function nature of the variant [5]. This is in contrast to gain-of-function SCN2A variants, which are often associated with earlier onset of seizures. The p.Arg853Gln variant has been reported to be de novo in a significant number of cases, indicating that it arises spontaneously rather than being inherited [1]. However, there are also instances where the variant has been inherited from a parent with a history of epilepsy or febrile seizures [1].The clinical phenotype associated with the p.Arg853Gln variant is variable, with some patients experiencing severe seizures that are often refractory to antiepileptic medications [4]. This refractoriness to treatment may be due in part to the presence of gating pore currents, which are aberrant currents flowing through a pathogenic ion conduction pathway created by the mutation. These gating pore currents can lead to a chronic depolarization of the membrane potential, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of seizures [4].In summary, the c.2558G>A p.Arg853Gln rs794727152 variant on the SCN2A gene is a pathogenic missense variant that results in a loss-of-function effect on the NaV1.2 channel, leading to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders with a predominant phenotype of late-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. The variant's impact on neuronal excitability and response to treatment underscores the importance of understanding the functional consequences of SCN2A variants for the development of targeted therapies.
