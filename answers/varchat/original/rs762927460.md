The genomic variant c.746A>T p.Asp249Val rs762927460 on the SCN1A gene is a missense mutation that results in the substitution of aspartic acid with valine at the protein level. This variant is associated with a wide spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes, which can range from milder forms such as GEFS+ (Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus) to more severe forms like Dravet syndrome (DS), a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy characterized by prolonged febrile and afebrile seizures in infancy, leading to drug-resistant epilepsy with cognitive, behavioral, and motor impairment [1].The SCN1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.1, which is critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Mutations in SCN1A can lead to altered channel function, affecting neuronal excitability and leading to a predisposition to seizures.In the context of ClinVar submissions, the variant rs762927460 has been reported with conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity, with one submission classifying it as pathogenic and another as having uncertain significance. This discrepancy highlights the complexity of variant interpretation and the need for further functional studies or additional evidence to clarify the clinical relevance of this specific variant.Given the role of SCN1A in neuronal excitability and the spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes associated with its variants, the c.746A>T p.Asp249Val mutation's impact on protein function is of significant clinical interest. However, the exact mechanism by which this variant contributes to the different epilepsy phenotypes remains to be fully elucidated, warranting further investigation into its functional consequences and genotype-phenotype correlations [1].
