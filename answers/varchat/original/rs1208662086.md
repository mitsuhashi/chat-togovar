The genomic variant c.4G>T p.Ala2Ser rs1208662086 is a missense mutation located in the SQSTM1 gene. SQSTM1 encodes for the protein sequestosome 1, which is also known as p62. This protein plays a crucial role in autophagy, a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components. Specifically, p62 serves as a cargo receptor that targets ubiquitinated proteins for degradation within the autophagosome, and it is also involved in signal transduction pathways related to inflammation and cell survival.The c.4G>T p.Ala2Ser variant results in the substitution of an alanine residue with a serine at the second position of the p62 protein. Although the papers provided do not directly discuss the functional consequences of this specific variant, they do provide insights into the broader functional context of the SQSTM1 gene and its protein product. For instance, p62/SQSTM1 is known to accumulate when autophagy is impaired, suggesting that mutations in SQSTM1 could potentially disrupt autophagy and lead to the accumulation of p62 and other autophagy substrates [2].Given the role of p62 in targeting ubiquitinated proteins for degradation, a missense mutation such as c.4G>T p.Ala2Ser could potentially alter the protein's ability to bind to ubiquitinated proteins or to autophagic machinery components, thereby affecting the efficiency of the autophagic process. However, without direct experimental evidence regarding the impact of the c.4G>T p.Ala2Ser variant on p62 function, the precise consequences of this mutation remain speculative.In summary, the SQSTM1 gene encodes for the p62 protein, which is integral to the autophagy pathway and cellular homeostasis. The c.4G>T p.Ala2Ser missense variant in SQSTM1 may affect the function of p62, potentially impacting the autophagic process and related cellular functions. Further experimental validation is required to determine the specific effects of this variant on protein function and its potential association with disease phenotypes.
