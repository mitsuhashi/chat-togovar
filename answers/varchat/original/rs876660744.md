The genomic variant c.907A>G p.Thr303Ala rs876660744 is located in the CDH1 gene, which encodes E-cadherin, a protein that plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity. E-cadherin is a key component of adherens junctions, which are essential for the establishment of the epithelial barrier function and for the prevention of invasive and metastatic behavior of epithelial cells. The CDH1 gene is therefore implicated in the regulation of tissue architecture and cellular signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and differentiation.The c.907A>G p.Thr303Ala variant results in the substitution of threonine with alanine at position 303 of the E-cadherin protein. This missense change is located in the extracellular domain of E-cadherin, which is important for its adhesive functions and for mediating homophilic calcium-dependent interactions between E-cadherin molecules on adjacent cells.ClinVar submissions for this variant include 2 benign and 3 with uncertain significance, indicating that there is some discrepancy in the interpretation of its clinical significance. The benign submissions suggest that this variant may not have a deleterious effect on the protein function or may represent a rare benign polymorphism in the population. However, the uncertain significance submissions indicate that there is not enough evidence to conclusively determine the impact of this variant on the protein function and its association with disease.In summary, the c.907A>G p.Thr303Ala rs876660744 variant in the CDH1 gene is a missense change with conflicting interpretations of its clinical significance. The variant's effect on E-cadherin's function and its potential association with disease remain to be fully elucidated through further functional studies and accumulation of clinical data.
