The genomic variant c.126_129del p.Phe42LeufsTer19 rs80356821 is located on the HBB gene, which encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is responsible for oxygen transport in the blood, and alterations in the HBB gene can lead to disorders such as beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. The c.126_129del variant results in a frameshift, leading to a premature termination codon at the 19th amino acid downstream from the site of the deletion. This change produces a truncated beta-globin protein, which can affect the normal function of hemoglobin and result in disease.The c.126_129del variant has been reported in multiple studies and is associated with beta-thalassemia, a condition characterized by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta-globin chains of hemoglobin. This variant was found in 5 out of 17 cases in a study population, representing a constituent ratio of 29.41% among beta-thalassemia mutations in that particular cohort [1]. In another study, the c.126_129del variant was reported with a frequency of 9.2% among different HBB gene mutations [2]. Furthermore, the variant was identified in cases of beta-thalassemia in a study that utilized Sanger sequencing of cord blood and non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) targeted capture sequencing [3].In a comprehensive study of beta-thalassemia patients, the c.126_129del variant was one of the mutations identified, further confirming its association with the disease [4]. Additionally, a large-scale study in southern Vietnam documented the c.126_129del variant among other mutations in the HBB gene, emphasizing its relevance in the genetic landscape of beta-thalassemia in Asian populations [5].ClinVar has recorded a total of 9 pathogenic submissions for the rs80356821 variant, supporting its clinical significance in relation to beta-thalassemia. The frameshift nature of the variant is consistent with the type of molecular defect that typically leads to the production of an abnormal or non-functional protein, contributing to the pathophysiology of hemoglobinopathies.
