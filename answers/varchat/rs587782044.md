The genomic variant c.1687G>A p.Ala563Thr rs587782044 is located in the CDH1 gene, which encodes E-cadherin, a protein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, maintaining the integrity of epithelial cell layers, and tumor suppression. E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates calcium-dependent intercellular adhesion and is involved in mechanisms regulating cell-cell adhesions, mobility, and proliferation of epithelial cells.The specific variant c.1687G>A results in the substitution of an alanine (Ala) with a threonine (Thr) at the 563rd amino acid position of the E-cadherin protein. This missense variant is characterized by the change of a single nucleotide, which alters the coding sequence but does not lead to a loss of the entire protein. The clinical significance of this variant has been classified as uncertain in ClinVar, with a total of four submissions reporting this classification. This uncertainty may be due to a lack of definitive evidence correlating the variant with a disease phenotype or conflicting data regarding its pathogenicity.Given the role of CDH1 in tumor suppression, variants within this gene are of particular interest in the context of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and other malignancies where E-cadherin function is critical. However, the papers provided do not discuss the variant c.1687G>A p.Ala563Thr rs587782044 in the context of the CDH1 gene or its associated phenotypes, and therefore, no specific information from these sources can be applied to the interpretation of this variant. In summary, while the variant c.1687G>A p.Ala563Thr rs587782044 in the CDH1 gene has been identified, its clinical significance remains uncertain, and further studies are needed to elucidate its impact on E-cadherin function and its potential association with disease.
