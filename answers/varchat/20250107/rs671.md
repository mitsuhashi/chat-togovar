The ALDH2 gene encodes for the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, which plays a crucial role in the detoxification of acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism, as well as other aldehydes generated from lipid peroxidation. The genomic variant c.1510G>A p.Glu504Lys, also known as rs671, results in the substitution of glutamic acid with lysine at the 504th amino acid position of the ALDH2 protein. This missense mutation has been extensively studied due to its significant impact on enzyme activity and its prevalence in East Asian populations.Individuals carrying the rs671 variant exhibit a substantial decrease in ALDH2 dehydrogenase activity. Heterozygotes (GA genotype) have an enzyme activity that ranges from 10-45% of that observed in individuals with the wild-type GG genotype, while homozygotes (AA genotype) display an activity of only 1-5% compared to the wild-type[3]. This reduction in activity is associated with an increased accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol consumption, leading to facial flushing and higher breath acetaldehyde levels. Specifically, heterozygotes for rs671 have been shown to experience a 6-fold increase in acetaldehyde levels relative to wild-type carriers, with breath acetaldehyde levels peaking at 9-fold 5 minutes after alcohol consumption[1].The rs671 variant has been implicated in a variety of disease risks, particularly in the context of alcohol consumption. It has been associated with an elevated risk of cancers, cerebral vascular disease, and has shown opposite effects in various cardiovascular diseases[3]. Moreover, the variant has been studied for its potential role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. While population cohort studies have produced contradictory results, research utilizing postmortem brain analysis has indicated that the rs671 variant affects amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology rather than susceptibility to AD. The variant has been linked to an increase in amyloid plaque load and a higher Abeta40/42 ratio, suggesting that the ALDH2 rs671 variant is not an independent risk factor for AD[3].The rs671 variant is also considered to be under strong recent natural selection pressure in the Japanese population and is thought to be a relatively young variant. It has been predicted to disrupt the structure of not only its own subunit but also its dimer partner within the tetrameric structure of ALDH2, leading to reduced stability and a dramatic reduction in enzyme activity[2].In summary, the ALDH2 c.1510G>A p.Glu504Lys rs671 variant is a missense mutation that results in decreased enzyme activity and increased acetaldehyde accumulation upon alcohol consumption. It has significant implications for disease risk and has been the subject of extensive research due to its prevalence in East Asian populations and its impact on ALDH2 function.
