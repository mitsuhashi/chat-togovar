The genomic variant c.1534G>T p.Asp512Tyr, designated as rs770792767, is located in the SUOX gene, which encodes the enzyme sulfite oxidase (SO). SO is crucial for the detoxification of sulfite, converting it into sulfate; this reaction is essential for normal brain function and development. Deficiency in SO activity due to mutations in the SUOX gene can lead to isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (ISOD), a condition characterized by severe neurological abnormalities, progressive brain atrophy, and early mortality.The specific missense variant c.1534G>T results in the substitution of aspartic acid with tyrosine at position 512 of the SO protein (p.Asp512Tyr). This variant has been identified as one of the inactive variants associated with ISOD. The inactivity of the variant implies a complete loss of function of the SO enzyme, which is consistent with the severe phenotype observed in patients with ISOD. The identification and characterization of this variant contribute to the understanding of the genetic basis of ISOD and assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with this rare disease [1].The incidence rate of ISOD has been calculated based on the combination of pathogenic SO missense variants and protein truncating variants, with the c.1534G>T p.Asp512Tyr variant being one of the identified pathogenic mutations. This comprehensive analysis has provided a pathogenicity score to naturally occurring SO missense variants, including the c.1534G>T p.Asp512Tyr, which is instrumental in the clinical interpretation of genetic data for ISOD [1].In ClinVar, the variant rs770792767 has been submitted with conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity. One submission classifies it as pathogenic, while another indicates a conflict in the interpretation of its clinical significance. This discrepancy highlights the complexity of variant interpretation and the necessity for continuous research and consensus in the field of genomics and rare diseases.
