The genomic variant c.-94-14674T>C, also known as rs12037987, is located within an intronic region of the WNT2B gene. This variant has been implicated in several studies concerning its association with stroke risk and cardiovascular diseases.WNT2B is a gene that encodes a member of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is known to play a crucial role in human development and carcinogenesis. The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in a variety of processes, including cell fate determination, cell migration, neural patterning, and organogenesis. Specifically, WNT2B is thought to contribute to the regulation of these processes within the central nervous system and other tissues [3].In the context of stroke susceptibility, rs12037987 has been associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in the Chinese Han population. A study found that individuals carrying the rs12037987 variant had a higher odds ratio for developing IS, particularly in women and in subjects younger than or equal to 65 years [1]. This suggests a potential sex-specific and age-related genetic susceptibility to IS conferred by this variant.Furthermore, rs12037987 was also identified as a novel stroke risk locus in a multiancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, highlighting its relevance across different populations [4]. However, it is important to note that the association between rs12037987 and stroke did not show a significant correlation with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, indicating a more specific role in cerebrovascular rather than neurodegenerative conditions [2].In another study, rs12037987 was found to be associated with elevated stroke susceptibility in individuals over 64 years of age, women, and non-smokers, suggesting that this variant may interact with environmental factors and other demographic characteristics to influence stroke risk [5]. Additionally, the variant was part of a redundancy relationship with other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a study that aimed to understand the genetic basis of stroke in the Han Chinese population [6].In summary, the intronic variant rs12037987 in the WNT2B gene has been associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, particularly in certain subgroups of the population. The WNT2B gene itself is an important component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is critical for various developmental and physiological processes. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which rs12037987 contributes to stroke susceptibility and to explore potential therapeutic targets within the Wnt signaling pathway [1][2][3][4][5][6].
