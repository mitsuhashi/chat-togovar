The genomic variant c.2728C>T p.Gln910Ter rs794726721 in the SCN1A gene is a nonsense mutation resulting in the introduction of a premature termination codon at amino acid position 910 of the encoded protein. This variant has been identified in a female patient (P406) and is classified as likely pathogenic in ClinVar with two pathogenic submissions. The mutation is de novo, meaning it occurred spontaneously and was not inherited from either parent [3].The SCN1A gene encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Na_v1.1, which is essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. The proper functioning of Na_v1.1 is critical for maintaining the excitability of neurons, particularly in the central nervous system. Mutations in SCN1A can lead to a spectrum of epilepsy syndromes, ranging from relatively mild forms like Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus (GEFS+) to more severe forms such as Dravet Syndrome (DS), which is characterized by frequent, prolonged seizures often triggered by fever, developmental delays, and other neurological deficits.Given the nature of the c.2728C>T p.Gln910Ter mutation, it is expected to result in a truncated protein product that lacks a significant portion of the C-terminal region, which may include transmembrane domains and the intracellular C-terminal domain critical for channel inactivation and interaction with intracellular partners. This loss of function can disrupt the normal sodium channel activity, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability and the clinical manifestations associated with SCN1A-related epilepsy syndromes. The stop-gained nature of this variant supports the hypothesis that truncated proteins resulting from nonsense mutations can lead to severe phenotypes by adversely affecting channel function [1].In summary, the c.2728C>T p.Gln910Ter rs794726721 variant in the SCN1A gene is a pathogenic mutation that likely causes a loss of function of the Na_v1.1 channel, contributing to the development of epilepsy and related neurological disorders.
