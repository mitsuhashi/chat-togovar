The genomic variant c.35G>T p.Gly12Val, also known as rs121913529, is a missense mutation located in the KRAS gene. This variant results in the substitution of glycine with valine at the 12th codon position of the KRAS protein. KRAS is a member of the RAS gene family and encodes a protein that functions as a GTPase, acting as a molecular switch in signal transduction pathways. It is involved in the regulation of cell division, differentiation, and apoptosis. Mutations in KRAS are known to perturb its GTPase activity, leading to continuous cell growth and division due to the inability to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, which is necessary for turning off the signaling cascade [1].The KRAS G12V mutation, as seen in c.35G>T p.Gly12Val, is one of the most common oncogenic mutations in the KRAS gene and is associated with various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung adenocarcinoma. In CRC, KRAS mutations are observed in about 45% of cases and are clinically associated with tumor invasion, metastasis, resistance to therapy, and a worse overall survival [2]. The G12V mutation, in particular, has been associated with worse overall survival compared to other KRAS mutations in CRC [2]. In lung adenocarcinoma, the KRAS G12V mutation has been identified in a subset of patients and is associated with unique clinicopathologic and genomic characteristics, although it does not appear to be a prognostic factor in resected lung adenocarcinoma [3].The G12V mutation has been shown to influence the biochemical and signaling properties of the KRAS protein differently compared to other KRAS mutations. Studies have indicated that KRAS G12V expressing cells have higher mTORC1 activity, leading to enrichment in signatures consistent with increased lipogenesis [2]. This suggests that the G12V mutation may confer unique metabolic properties to cancer cells, which could influence their sensitivity to targeted therapies. Targeting ACSS2, an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach for G12V mutant CRC [2].Despite the challenges in targeting KRAS due to its previously deemed "undruggable" nature, the development of allele-specific inhibitors has provided new avenues for treatment. While the FDA has approved inhibitors for the G12C mutation in lung cancer, there is an ongoing need for effective drugs targeting other mutations such as G12V [4]. Research efforts continue to explore the landscape of KRAS mutations, including the G12V variant, to better understand their functional impact and to develop targeted therapies [5].In summary, the c.35G>T p.Gly12Val rs121913529 variant in the KRAS gene is a pathogenic mutation with significant implications for oncogenesis and cancer progression. It affects the protein's function and signaling, leading to aberrant cell growth and survival, and presents challenges and opportunities in the context of targeted cancer therapy.
