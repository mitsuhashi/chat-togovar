The genomic variant c.35G>T p.Gly12Val, also known as rs121913529, is a missense mutation located in the KRAS gene, which encodes the KRAS protein, a member of the RAS family of GTPases. This protein plays a critical role in regulating cell division, cell differentiation, and cell death through signal transduction pathways. The KRAS gene is a proto-oncogene, and its product is involved in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for the control of several cellular processes including proliferation, survival, and metabolism.The c.35G>T p.Gly12Val mutation results in the substitution of a glycine (Gly) with a valine (Val) at the 12th amino acid position of the KRAS protein. This alteration is located in a region critical for the GTPase activity of the protein, which is responsible for cycling between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states. The Gly12Val mutation impairs the intrinsic GTPase activity of KRAS, leading to an accumulation of the GTP-bound form, which constitutively activates downstream signaling pathways and promotes oncogenesis [1].KRAS mutations, including the Gly12Val variant, are associated with a variety of cancers, with the KRAS gene being one of the most frequently mutated in human tumors. The G12D mutation, which is similar to the Gly12Val mutation, has been extensively studied and is known to disrupt the interaction between KRAS and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), preventing the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation [1]. Although the Gly12Val mutation is less common than G12D, it is presumed to have a similar impact on KRAS function and oncogenic potential.The presence of KRAS mutations, including Gly12Val, has been investigated in the context of lung adenocarcinoma, where it was found to be more frequent in males and former/current smokers. The mutation was also associated with specific clinicopathologic features and co-occurring genomic alterations, such as TP53 and STK11 mutations [2]. In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), KRAS mutations are particularly prevalent and have been the focus of drug development efforts due to the poor prognosis associated with these tumors [3].Efforts to target KRAS mutations therapeutically have led to the development of inhibitors, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, which are FDA-approved for treating lung cancers with the G12C mutation. However, inhibitors for the Gly12Val mutation are still under investigation, with recent studies exploring non-covalent inhibitors and machine learning algorithms to identify potential drug candidates [3][5].Additionally, deep mutational scanning has been used to explore the functional impact of various KRAS mutations, including the Gly12Val variant, providing insights into the mechanisms of KRAS-mediated oncogenesis and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention [4].In summary, the KRAS c.35G>T p.Gly12Val rs121913529 variant is a pathogenic missense mutation that alters the function of the KRAS protein, leading to constitutive activation of oncogenic signaling pathways. This mutation is implicated in the development of various cancers and is the subject of ongoing research to develop targeted therapies. With 41 pathogenic submissions in ClinVar, the significance of this variant in oncology is well recognized.
