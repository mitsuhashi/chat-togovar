The genomic variant c.3140A>C results in a missense mutation in the PIK3CA gene, where histidine at position 1047 is replaced by proline (p.His1047Pro), and is cataloged in databases with the identifier rs121913279. This variant has been extensively studied and is associated with various forms of cancer. The PIK3CA gene encodes the p110Î± catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Mutations in PIK3CA can lead to aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway, contributing to oncogenesis.In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in an Indian population, the c.3140A>C variant has been observed in a heterozygous state in 52% of patients, with no homozygous mutations detected. The presence of this variant was associated with a decreased overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), indicating a poor prognosis for patients carrying the mutation [1]. This variant is also prevalent in breast cancer, where it has been shown to induce multi-lineage and multi-potency in mammary tumors [1]. Furthermore, the c.3140A>C variant has been implicated in the development of mucinous adenocarcinomas and hyperplasia in colon cancer [1].Selective inhibition of the PIK3CA variant over the wild-type protein is crucial due to the essential role of the wild-type protein in normal cellular processes. There has been progress in the development of selective inhibitors targeting the PIK3CA variant, with one such inhibitor showing promising results in preclinical models [2].In canine mammary tumors (CMTs), the c.3140A>C variant was detected in 41.7% of benign cases and varied according to the histological grade of malignant cases. The mutation was more prominent in benign and grade I malignant CMT cases compared to higher-grade malignancies [3].Overall, the c.3140A>C p.His1047Pro variant in the PIK3CA gene is a significant oncogenic mutation with implications for cancer prognosis and treatment. Its prevalence and impact on survival rates underscore the importance of genetic screening and targeted therapies in the management of cancers harboring this mutation. ClinVar submissions further support the pathogenic nature of this variant, with a majority of submissions classifying it as pathogenic and one as oncogenic.
