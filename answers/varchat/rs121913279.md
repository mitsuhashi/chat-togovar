The genomic variant c.3140A>C p.His1047Pro rs121913279 on the PIK3CA gene is a missense mutation that results in the substitution of histidine with proline at the 1047th amino acid position. This variant has been identified in various cancer types, with a notable prevalence in breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In a study of Indian HNSCC patients, the H1047R mutation, which is similar in position but different in the substituted amino acid, was found in a heterozygous state in 52% of the cases, and it was associated with a decreased overall survival and progression-free survival, indicating a poor prognosis for patients carrying this mutation [1]. The variant has not been reported in a homozygous state in this population, suggesting that even in a heterozygous state, it can exert a significant oncogenic effect.The PIK3CA gene encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This pathway plays a critical role in cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival. Mutations in PIK3CA can lead to the activation of this pathway, contributing to oncogenesis and cancer progression. The H1047R mutation, in particular, has been shown to induce conformational changes in the protein complex, leading to oncogenic activity [1].Selective targeting of PIK3CA mutations is crucial for cancer therapy, as the wild-type PI3Kα plays important roles in normal cellular processes. There has been progress in the development of selective inhibitors for PI3Kα with the H1047R mutation, with one such inhibitor showing promising results in preclinical models, providing tumor regressions and a clear pharmacodynamic response [2].In addition to human cancers, the H1047R mutation has also been studied in canine mammary tumors (CMTs), where it was detected in a significant proportion of benign and grade I malignant cases, suggesting a role in the early stages of tumorigenesis [3].Overall, the c.3140A>C p.His1047Pro rs121913279 variant in the PIK3CA gene is a missense mutation associated with oncogenic potential, poor prognosis in cancer patients, and is a target for selective inhibitor development. ClinVar submissions have classified this variant as pathogenic and oncogenic, reflecting its established role in cancer.
