The genomic variant c.716A>T p.Asn239Ile, denoted as rs1057519999, is a missense mutation located in the TP53 gene. TP53, commonly known as the tumor suppressor p53, plays a critical role in cellular stress responses, including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, and metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers due to its pivotal function in maintaining genomic stability and preventing oncogenesis.The specific variant p.Asn239Ile has been studied in the context of its impact on the TP53 protein function. The asparagine at position 239 is situated within the DNA binding domain of p53, a region that is highly conserved across species, indicating its importance in the protein's function [1]. This particular residue, N239, has been identified as a medium hotspot for mutations, which suggests that alterations at this site could have significant implications for the protein's ability to interact with DNA and regulate gene expression [1].Functional assays have demonstrated that the p.Asn239Ile variant results in a loss of function of the TP53 protein. Specifically, the mutant form of p53 with the N239I substitution has been shown to lose its DNA binding ability to promoters regulated by wild-type p53. This loss of function extends to the regulation of transcription of key genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, such as p21 Cip1/Waf1, cyclin G, PUMA, and Bax, particularly in response to DNA damage signals like irradiation [1]. Consequently, the p.Asn239Ile variant impairs the tumor suppressive capabilities of the TP53 protein, which could potentially contribute to tumorigenesis.Despite the loss of function, the gain-of-function effects of the p.Asn239Ile variant have not been fully elucidated. However, it has been suggested that different p53 mutants, including those at the N239 residue, can vary dramatically in their oncogenic potential and interactions with other oncogenes, such as Ras [1]. This highlights the complexity of TP53 mutations and the need for further research to understand the full spectrum of their biological consequences.In summary, the c.716A>T p.Asn239Ile rs1057519999 variant in the TP53 gene is a pathogenic missense mutation that compromises the DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory functions of the p53 protein. This mutation is associated with a loss of tumor suppressor activity, which is critical for the prevention of cancer development. The variant's prevalence in ClinVar, with a majority of submissions classifying it as pathogenic, further supports its significance in disease pathology.
