The genomic variant c.152G>A p.Gly51Asp rs431905511 is located in the SNCA gene, which encodes the alpha-synuclein protein. Alpha-synuclein is a protein of significant interest due to its abundant expression in the human brain and its proposed role in vesicle recycling. The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 17 kDa and is a major constituent of intracellular inclusions that are pathological hallmarks of alpha-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In PD and DLB, these inclusions are predominantly neuronal, forming Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites (LN), whereas in MSA, they are primarily found in oligodendrocytes as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) [2].The c.152G>A p.Gly51Asp variant results from a single nucleotide change that leads to the substitution of glycine (Gly) with aspartic acid (Asp) at the 51st amino acid position of the alpha-synuclein protein. This missense mutation has been associated with autosomal dominant forms of PD and exhibits clinical and neuropathological features that overlap with both PD and MSA. Affected individuals with this mutation may present with early-onset Parkinson's disease, dementia, and a range of symptoms including levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, hallucinations, and autonomic dysfunction. Neuropathological examination of affected individuals has revealed widespread neuronal alpha-synuclein positive cytoplasmic inclusions, as well as GCI-like inclusions in oligodendrocytes [2].Functional studies in animal models have demonstrated the feasibility of introducing the G51D mutation into the rat SNCA gene, with subsequent transmission through the germline. This has allowed for the generation of rat models that can be genotyped using PCR and restriction enzyme digest, taking advantage of a new BspHI restriction site introduced by the mutation. These models do not exhibit reduced embryonic or fetal viability, suggesting that the mutation does not significantly impact early development [1].The G51D mutation has been shown to cluster in a putative protein loop of alpha-synuclein, which is important for lipid binding and fibril formation. The disruption of this loop by the mutation may significantly alter the behavior of the alpha-synuclein protein, potentially influencing the pathways leading to neuronal or glial protein aggregation. The variability in the neuropathological features associated with different SNCA mutations suggests that alterations in the alpha-synuclein structure may determine the specific neuropathology observed [2].Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines have been generated from individuals with the SNCA G51D mutation, providing a resource for disease modeling and therapy development studies for synucleinopathies. These iPSCs exhibit normal morphology, express pluripotency markers, and can differentiate into the three germ layers [4].In summary, the c.152G>A p.Gly51Asp rs431905511 variant in the SNCA gene is associated with a rare autosomal dominant form of Parkinson's disease that shares characteristics with both PD and MSA. The mutation affects a critical region of the alpha-synuclein protein and has been linked to distinct clinical and neuropathological phenotypes. This variant is reported as pathogenic in ClinVar, reflecting its established role in disease.
