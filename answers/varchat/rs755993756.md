The genomic variant c.616A>G p.Thr206Ala rs755993756 is a missense mutation located in the CREB1 gene. This variant results in the substitution of threonine with alanine at the 206th amino acid position of the CREB1 protein. The CREB1 gene encodes the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1, which is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in response to various stimuli. CREB1 is involved in various cellular processes including cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, and it is known to mediate transcription via cAMP-responsive elements (CRE) within gene promoters [1].The CREB1 protein is phosphorylated by protein kinase A in response to elevated cAMP levels, but it is also a substrate for the mitogen and stress-activated kinases (MSKs)-1 and -2, which are activated by ERK and p38alpha MAPKs. This phosphorylation event is important for the transcriptional activation functions of CREB1. The phosphorylation of CREB1 by MSKs is associated with the regulation of genes involved in the stress response, such as DUSP1/MKP-1, which is a gene that encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in the negative feedback regulation of MAPK signaling [1].The specific impact of the c.616A>G p.Thr206Ala variant on the function of the CREB1 protein is not detailed in the provided literature. However, given the importance of phosphorylation in the regulation of CREB1 activity, a missense mutation at an amino acid position that could be involved in kinase interaction or regulation could potentially alter the protein's phosphorylation status and thus its activity as a transcription factor. Further functional studies would be required to determine the exact consequences of this variant on CREB1 function and related cellular pathways.In summary, the c.616A>G p.Thr206Ala rs755993756 variant in the CREB1 gene results in an amino acid substitution that could potentially affect the protein's phosphorylation and its role as a transcription factor in various cellular processes [1].
