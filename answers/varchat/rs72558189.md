The genomic variant c.374G>A, resulting in the amino acid substitution p.Arg125His (rs72558189), is located on the CYP2C9 gene. This variant is associated with the CYP2C9*14 haplotype and has been identified as a nonsynonymous change, which is predicted to be deleterious with a SIFT score of 0.05 and benign with a PolyPhen score of 0.445 [1]. The allele frequency of this variant has been reported to be 0.0042 in a Pakistani population, suggesting a degree of population-specific prevalence [2]. Furthermore, the variant has been observed at a frequency of 0.231% in a study that cataloged P450 2C9 variants [3].The CYP2C9 gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which are critical for the metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including clinically important drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), phenytoin, warfarin, and prasugrel. Variants in this gene can affect drug metabolism and influence the efficacy and toxicity of medications [2].The c.374G>A variant has been evaluated for its impact on protein function and stability. A pathogenicity score of 0.998 indicates that this substitution is likely pathogenic, and the predicted stability score (DeltaDeltaG) for the variant is 0.44 kcal/mol, suggesting potential alterations in protein stability [4]. The variant allele has been reported with varying frequencies across different populations, with a notable presence in South Asian populations at a frequency of 2.094% [5].In summary, the c.374G>A p.Arg125His rs72558189 variant in the CYP2C9 gene is a missense change that has been predicted to be deleterious based on computational analysis, with a benign PolyPhen score. It exhibits population-specific frequency patterns and has potential clinical significance due to its impact on drug metabolism. Despite being classified as benign in a ClinVar submission, the variant's pathogenicity score and population frequency data suggest that it may have functional consequences that could be relevant for pharmacogenomic considerations.
