The genomic variant c.5644C>A p.Arg1882= rs796053166 on the SCN2A gene is a synonymous variant, which means that it does not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. SCN2A encodes the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2, which plays a critical role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. This channel is essential for the proper functioning of the central nervous system and is implicated in a variety of epilepsy syndromes and related neurodevelopmental disorders.Despite being a synonymous variant, rs796053166 has been implicated in the clinical phenotype of epilepsy syndromes. Specifically, the variant has been associated with a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes, including neonatal-infantile seizures and later-onset episodic ataxia [2]. The variant has been identified in patients presenting with neonatal-onset seizures that remit after several months, followed by the onset of episodic ataxia in early childhood [2]. This clinical presentation suggests that the variant may have functional consequences that contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability, even though it does not change the protein sequence.Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that the mutation p.Arg1882Gly, which affects the same residue as the synonymous variant rs796053166, causes gain-of-function effects on NaV1.2 channels [2][7]. These effects include a hyperpolarizing shift of the activation curve and an increase in sodium current density, which are consistent with increased neuronal excitability and a predisposition to seizures [7]. Although the synonymous variant rs796053166 does not alter the amino acid sequence, it is possible that it could affect mRNA stability, splicing, or other regulatory mechanisms that influence the expression or function of the NaV1.2 channel.The SCN2A gene has been extensively studied, and more than 150 de novo missense mutations have been reported to date, many of which result in epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders [1]. The variant rs796053166 is located in a region of SCN2A that has been described as a mutation hotspot, further supporting the potential clinical relevance of variants in this region [1].In summary, the SCN2A variant c.5644C>A p.Arg1882= rs796053166 is a synonymous variant that has been associated with epilepsy syndromes characterized by neonatal-infantile seizures and later-onset episodic ataxia. Although synonymous variants do not typically affect protein function directly, this variant may influence the expression or function of the NaV1.2 channel in ways that contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders. ClinVar submissions for this variant include 9 pathogenic and 1 benign submission, indicating a potential role in disease but also highlighting the complexity of interpreting its clinical significance.
