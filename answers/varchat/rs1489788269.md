The genomic variant c.797A>G p.Glu266Gly, designated as rs1489788269, is located in the ALOXE3 gene. This missense variant results in the substitution of glutamic acid with glycine at the 266th amino acid position of the protein. The ALOXE3 gene encodes an enzyme that is a member of the lipoxygenase family and plays a critical role in the epidermal differentiation complex, which is essential for skin barrier function and integrity. Specifically, ALOXE3 is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids in the skin, contributing to the formation of lipid-based barrier structures.The clinical significance of the c.797A>G p.Glu266Gly variant in ALOXE3 has been evaluated in the context of hereditary ichthyosis, a group of disorders characterized by dry, thickened, and scaly skin. However, this particular variant has been classified as a variant of uncertain significance, indicating that its impact on the ALOXE3 protein function and its contribution to hereditary ichthyosis are not yet fully understood [1]. The variant's classification is based on a single submission in ClinVar, which reflects the need for further research and additional evidence to establish its pathogenicity or lack thereof.Given the role of ALOXE3 in skin health, variants within this gene can potentially disrupt normal skin barrier formation and maintenance, leading to clinical manifestations associated with ichthyosis. However, without more definitive functional studies or additional genetic evidence, the pathogenicity of the c.797A>G p.Glu266Gly variant remains uncertain. Further genetic analysis, such as segregation studies within affected families and functional assays, would be necessary to clarify the clinical relevance of this variant and its potential role in hereditary ichthyosis.
