The genomic variant c.126_129del p.Phe42LeufsTer19, also known as rs1235072590, is located on the HBB gene, which encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a critical protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. The HBB gene is essential for the proper function of hemoglobin and, consequently, for the effective transport of oxygen.The c.126_129del p.Phe42LeufsTer19 variant results in the deletion of four nucleotides, leading to a frameshift and the creation of a premature termination codon at the 19th amino acid position downstream from the mutation site. This frameshift mutation is predicted to cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which would likely result in a loss of normal protein function [1]. The variant has been reported in individuals with a relevant phenotype, specifically beta-thalassemia, a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin [1].In a study examining mutations in patients with thalassemia, the c.126_129del p.Phe42LeufsTer19 variant was identified as one of the heterozygous mutations present in the HBB gene [1]. Another study found this variant to be the most common HBB gene mutation, present in 34 alleles (23.8%) among the alleles studied, excluding the HbE mutation [2]. This variant has been associated with beta-thalassemia disease, with cases reported of both homozygous individuals and compound heterozygotes with other HBB gene mutations [2].A case study of a pregnant woman with a homozygous c.126_129del p.Phe42LeufsTer19 mutation revealed an unexpectedly mild phenotype of beta-thalassemia, which was attributed to high levels of Hb F and genetic modifiers that ameliorate the severity of the disease [3]. The patient's mild phenotype was also influenced by a KLF1 mutation and homozygous HBS1L-MYB variants, which are known to upregulate the expression of the gamma-globin gene and are associated with Hb F levels [3].The variant has been detected using various genetic analysis techniques, including reverse dot blot (RDB) method, DNA sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) [3]. It has been characterized as a common beta0-thalassemia mutation in certain populations, with most homozygous patients presenting with a classic transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia major phenotype [3].In summary, the c.126_129del p.Phe42LeufsTer19 variant in the HBB gene is a frameshift mutation that leads to a premature stop codon and is associated with beta-thalassemia. It is a pathogenic variant with multiple submissions in ClinVar supporting its role in disease. The presence of this variant can have significant clinical implications, particularly in homozygous or compound heterozygous states, and its detection is crucial for the diagnosis and management of beta-thalassemia.
