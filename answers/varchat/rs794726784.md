The genomic variant c.4223G>A p.Trp1408Ter rs794726784 in the SCN1A gene is a nonsense mutation resulting in the introduction of a premature termination codon at amino acid position 1408 (Trp1408Ter). This variant has been identified in the context of severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), also known as Dravet syndrome (DS), which is a rare and severe form of epilepsy that begins in infancy [4]. The c.4223G>A variant has been reported to be associated with a clinical phenotype characterized by severe mental decline and childhood epilepsies [3]. In a study involving mosaic parent information, this variant was found in a mother with undefined epilepsy, suggesting a potential link between the variant and the epilepsy phenotype [2].The SCN1A gene encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na_v1.1, which is critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Mutations in SCN1A can lead to a variety of epilepsy syndromes, with the c.4223G>A variant contributing to the loss of function of the sodium channel, thereby affecting neuronal excitability and leading to the clinical manifestations of SMEI [4].ClinVar has two pathogenic submissions for the rs794726784 variant, which is consistent with the reported clinical significance of this variant in the literature. The stop gained nature of this variant is expected to result in a truncated protein product that lacks critical functional domains necessary for the proper functioning of the sodium channel, contributing to the pathogenicity of the variant.
