The genomic variant c.1799T>G p.Val600Gly rs113488022 is located in the BRAF gene, which encodes a protein that is a member of the RAF kinase family within the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in regulating cell division, differentiation, and secretion. The BRAF protein plays a central role in this pathway by acting as a kinase that phosphorylates and activates the MEK protein, which in turn activates ERK, leading to the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival.The c.1799T>G p.Val600Gly variant results in the substitution of valine with glycine at position 600 in the BRAF protein. This position is critical for the kinase activity of BRAF, and mutations at this site can lead to constitutive activation of the BRAF kinase, independent of upstream signals. The variant has been associated with various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), where it has been shown to mediate a distinctive epigenetic mechanism involving the phosphorylation of MAFG and subsequent recruitment of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, leading to hypermethylation of CpG islands and an aging-like epigenetic pattern in the genome [2].In CRC, BRAF mutations can be classified into three major categories based on their biological effects. Class I mutations, which include the V600E mutation, result in the formation of an active monomer with kinase activity that is insensitive to upstream signals and downstream negative feedback. This variant is associated with specific clinical features and a poor prognosis in CRC patients, with a higher frequency of metastasis in the peritoneum and distant lymph nodes, and a significant association with right-sided colon tumors, poorer differentiation, mucinous histology, and larger primary tumors [4].The presence of the BRAF V600E mutation has been linked to a distinct distribution of patients according to the frequency of the mutated allele, with a wide range of values observed for the normalized proportion of mutated BRAF alleles [1]. Furthermore, CRC patients with BRAF V600E mutations exhibit distinct prognostic features and differential gene expression patterns, which can classify them into two unique subtypes, BM1 and BM2, with BM1 characterized by poorer prognosis [2].ClinVar submissions for the c.1799T>G p.Val600Gly rs113488022 variant in the BRAF gene indicate a predominance of pathogenic classifications, with a total of 30 pathogenic submissions, 2 somatic with strong clinical significance, 1 oncogenic, and 1 with uncertain significance. This suggests that the variant is predominantly associated with disease, particularly in the context of cancer, where it has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of malignancies through its constitutive kinase activity and downstream effects on cell proliferation and survival.
