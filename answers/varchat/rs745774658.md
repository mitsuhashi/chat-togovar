The genomic variant c.1399G>A p.Ala467Thr rs745774658 in the SCN2A gene is a missense variant that results in the substitution of alanine with threonine at the 467th amino acid position. This variant has been identified in individuals presenting with a range of neurological phenotypes, particularly refractory epilepsy with developmental delay. In one study, two probands carrying this variant exhibited similar phenotypes characterized by refractory epilepsy and developmental delay, suggesting a potential pathogenic role for this variant [1]. However, the variant's clinical significance remains uncertain, as it has been submitted to ClinVar with conflicting interpretations, including one benign and three with uncertain significance.The SCN2A gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na_v1.2, which is critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Na_v1.2 channels are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and play a key role in neuronal excitability and firing patterns. Mutations in SCN2A can lead to a wide spectrum of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, autism, intellectual disability, and other neurodevelopmental disorders due to their impact on neuronal function.The c.1399G>A p.Ala467Thr variant is located in a region of the SCN2A gene that is important for the function of the sodium channel, and missense mutations in this gene can lead to either gain-of-function or loss-of-function effects, which can disrupt the normal balance of neuronal excitability. The functional implications of the p.Ala467Thr variant specifically have been described in relation to protein instability, and it has been associated with intellectual disability without epilepsy in one study, and with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy in another, highlighting the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance often observed with SCN2A variants [1].In a genetic study of a monozygotic twin family with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), the c.1399G>A variant was identified as a new mutation not previously reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). The presence of the mutation correlated with the phenotype in the affected twins, while asymptomatic family members did not harbor this mutation, suggesting a potential pathogenic role [4].In summary, the c.1399G>A p.Ala467Thr rs745774658 variant in the SCN2A gene is a missense change with uncertain clinical significance, implicated in neurological phenotypes such as refractory epilepsy and developmental delay. The SCN2A gene itself is crucial for proper neuronal function, and mutations can have significant impacts on neurodevelopment and neuronal excitability. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the pathogenicity and clinical implications of this specific variant.
