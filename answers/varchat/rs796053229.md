The genomic variant c.5615G>A, resulting in the amino acid substitution p.Arg1872Gln in the SCN8A gene, has been identified as a de novo mutation, meaning it was not present in either parent of the affected individuals [1]. This variant is associated with early-onset seizures, developmental delay, and cognitive impairment, as demonstrated in clinical exome sequencing studies of patients with these phenotypes [1]. The SCN8A gene encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6, which is critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons, and mutations in this gene can lead to a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes [6].Functional studies of the p.Arg1872Gln variant have shown that it, along with other mutations at the same arginine residue (p.Arg1872Trp and p.Arg1872Leu), affects the electrophysiological properties of the Nav1.6 channel when expressed in ND7/23 cells. These mutations have been characterized by their interactions with other proteins such as FGF14, G-protein subunit Gbetagamma, and sodium channel subunit beta1, which are assessed by coimmunoprecipitation [1]. The p.Arg1872Gln variant is one of several recurrent mutations at the arginine 1872 residue, which is evolutionarily conserved and located in a region with a high occurrence of CpG dinucleotides, making it a hotspot for de novo mutations due to cytosine methylation and deamination [2].The clinical significance of the p.Arg1872Gln variant is further supported by its classification in ClinVar, where it has been submitted a total of five times with a pathogenic designation. This variant has been observed in multiple unrelated individuals, indicating a recurring mutation event [2]. Moreover, systematic comparisons of the p.Arg1872Gln variant with other SCN8A epilepsy mutations have revealed common dysfunctions in resurgent current, which is a key factor in neuronal excitability and may explain the seizure activities observed in patients [4].In summary, the c.5615G>A p.Arg1872Gln variant in the SCN8A gene is a pathogenic missense mutation associated with a range of neurological symptoms, including early-onset seizures and developmental delays. Its pathogenicity is supported by both functional studies and clinical observations, as well as its recurrent nature and presence in a mutation hotspot within the gene [1][2][4].
