The genomic variant c.-77+23892A>G, known as rs880315, is located within the intronic region of the CASZ1 gene on chromosome 1. This variant has been implicated in multiple studies concerning blood pressure regulation and the risk of hypertension. Specifically, rs880315 has been associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in a genome-wide association study (GWAS), where it showed a significant p-value, although it did not reach nominal significance in a subsequent study [1][3]. Furthermore, the allele frequency of the A allele in the 1,000 Genomes Project was reported, providing a broader context for its prevalence across different populations [2].The CASZ1 gene encodes the zinc finger protein castor homolog 1, which is a transcription factor involved in cell-cycle signaling and apoptosis regulation. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including cardiac myocytes, and has been associated with cell proliferation, development, differentiation, and carcinogenesis [6]. In addition to its role in cellular functions, CASZ1 has been identified as a significant locus associated with blood pressure and hypertension in GWASs, suggesting a role in cardiovascular health [6].The variant rs880315 has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension, particularly in women and in certain age groups. It was nominally associated with hypertension (DBP>=90 mmHg) in the mid-tier age group (>=30 to <60 years) and has shown an increased risk of hypertension in women of European ancestry. Additionally, the variant has been linked to SBP in women and to hypertension, SBP, and DBP in the Japanese population [2]. This suggests a potential sex-specific and age-related impact of the variant on blood pressure traits.In a study focused on the Chinese population, rs880315 was associated with reduced stroke susceptibility, particularly in individuals aged <=64 years and women, indicating a protective effect against stroke in these subgroups [7]. This further emphasizes the variant's relevance to cardiovascular health and its potential influence on the risk of vascular events.In summary, the intronic variant rs880315 in the CASZ1 gene has been associated with blood pressure regulation and the risk of hypertension, with a particular emphasis on its impact on women and certain age groups. The gene itself plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including those relevant to cardiovascular health.
