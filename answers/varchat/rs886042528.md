The genomic variant c.1264G>T p.Val422Leu rs886042528 on the SCN1A gene is a missense mutation that has been associated with a severe neurological phenotype. This variant results in the substitution of valine to leucine at amino acid position 422. The SCN1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the type 1 voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV1.1), which is critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Mutations in SCN1A can lead to a variety of epilepsy syndromes, including Dravet syndrome, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), and other epileptic encephalopathies.The c.1264G>T p.Val422Leu variant has been specifically identified in a patient with early infantile SCN1A encephalopathy, a condition more severe than Dravet syndrome, characterized by profound developmental impairment and a prominent movement disorder with choreoathetosis, dystonia, and perioral hyperkinesia [6]. This phenotype is distinct from the typical seizure onset age range and intellectual disability seen in Dravet syndrome. The variant was described in a Japanese child presenting with infantile epileptic encephalopathy, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and hand stereotypies, indicating a severe impact on neurological function [6].Furthermore, the c.1264G>T variant has been reported in ClinVar with a total of four pathogenic submissions, supporting its association with disease. The conservation analysis and predictive functional assessments such as SIFT and Align-GVGD have indicated that this variant affects a highly conserved amino acid and is likely to impact the protein function [2]. The variant was classified as C15 by Align-GVGD, suggesting a high likelihood of being deleterious [2].In summary, the c.1264G>T p.Val422Leu rs886042528 variant in the SCN1A gene is a pathogenic mutation associated with severe neurological phenotypes, including early infantile SCN1A encephalopathy. The functional impact of this variant is supported by its conservation, predictive functional analyses, and clinical observations.
