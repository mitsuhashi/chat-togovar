Certainly! As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the specific allele frequency of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), such as **rs1208662086**, can often be retrieved from genomic databases like:

1. **dbSNP** (hosted by NCBI): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/
2. **1000 Genomes Project**: http://www.internationalgenome.org
3. **gnomAD** (Genome Aggregation Database): https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org

These databases contain allele frequency data across various populations, including Japanese cohorts, if the SNP has been studied.

For Japanese populations specifically, the **Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization (ToMMo)** and the **Japanese Genotype-Tissue Expression project (JPT in 1000 Genomes)** are valuable resources that report allele frequencies for Japanese groups. You can cross-reference the SNP of interest with their publicly shared datasets.

### Steps to look it up:
1. Visit dbSNP or other mentioned resources.
2. Search for rsID: **rs1208662086**.
3. Check the Allele Frequency table under the population-specific breakdown section (e.g., "EAS" for East Asians or specifically "JPT" for Japanese in 1000 Genomes).

If you've already tried these resources and couldn't find the information, the SNP might not have been studied in depth for that specific population yet, or it might be a rare or novel variant.

Let me know if you'd like guidance in navigating these resources!
