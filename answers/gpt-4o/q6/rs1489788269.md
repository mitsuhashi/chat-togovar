To determine whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1489788269 influences drug metabolism or drug response, several factors need to be considered, including the gene in which the SNP is located, the functional impact of the variant, and any supporting studies.

However, as of now, **rs1489788269** is not a well-characterized SNP in terms of its influence on drug metabolism or response. It might be a rare or less-studied variant, and there seems to be little to no information available about its functional effects or clinical relevance in pharmacogenomics databases such as PharmGKB, ClinVar, or dbSNP.

### How to investigate further:
1. **Confirm gene location**: Check the gene where rs1489788269 resides and determine if the gene itself is known to influence drug metabolism or response. Many genes, such as those from the *CYP* family (e.g., *CYP2D6*, *CYP3A4*), *SLCO1B1*, *UGT*, or *ABCB1*, are directly involved in pharmacokinetics.

2. **Access large-scale pharmacogenomic data sources**:
   - Search in **PharmGKB** for pharmacogenomic associations.
   - Look into studies in GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) catalogs.
   - Check for functional annotations in **dbSNP**, **Ensembl**, or **ClinVar**.

3. **Variant frequency and impact**:
   - Determine whether rs1489788269 influences protein function, using tools like **PolyPhen-2**, **SIFT**, or **CADD** scores.
   - Assess population frequency to see if it is a common variant or a rare one, using data from gnomAD.

4. **Experimental or clinical studies**:
   - Look for specific experimental studies or case-control studies linking rs1489788269 to drug metabolism, transporters, or receptors.

If you provide the name of the gene or additional context, I can assist in narrowing the search and determining if the variant plays a role in pharmacogenetic traits. If rs1489788269 is newly identified or rare, its influence might require further functional validation through experimental studies.
