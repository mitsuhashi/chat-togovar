The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs1489788269** does not appear to be well-characterized in the current scientific literature or major pharmacogenomic databases as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023. It is not listed in widely used pharmacogenomic resources such as the **PharmGKB**, **ClinVar**, or **dbSNP** databases as being associated with drug metabolism or response.

To determine whether rs1489788269 influences drug metabolism or response, you would need to consider the following steps:

1. **Gene Context**: Identify the gene in which rs1489788269 is located. Many pharmacogenomic effects are gene-specific, particularly in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP450 family), drug transporters (e.g., ABC transporters), or drug targets (e.g., receptors or enzymes).

2. **Functional Impact**: Determine whether rs1489788269 is a coding variant (e.g., missense, nonsense), a regulatory variant (e.g., in a promoter or enhancer region), or a non-coding variant. Functional variants in genes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP3A4) or drug transport (e.g., ABCB1) are more likely to influence drug response.

3. **Population Frequency**: Check the allele frequency of rs1489788269 in different populations using resources like **gnomAD** or **1000 Genomes**. Rare variants may have a significant impact on drug response in specific individuals or populations.

4. **Experimental Evidence**: Search for experimental or clinical studies that have investigated the association of rs1489788269 with drug metabolism or response. This can be done using databases like **PubMed**, **PharmGKB**, or **GWAS Catalog**.

5. **In Silico Predictions**: Use bioinformatics tools to predict the functional impact of rs1489788269. Tools like **SIFT**, **PolyPhen-2**, or **CADD** can provide insights into whether the variant is likely to be deleterious.

If you have additional information about the gene or context of rs1489788269, I can help refine the search or provide more specific insights. Alternatively, if this SNP is newly identified or rare, further research may be required to determine its role in drug metabolism or response.
