The single-nucleotide variation **rs794726721** has been associated with drug metabolism and response since it corresponds to a pathogenic mutation in the **CYP2C19** gene. Specifically, it designates the **CYP2C19*35** allele, which represents a frameshift mutation that produces a truncated, nonfunctional protein.

### **Impact of rs794726721 on Drug Metabolism**
The CYP2C19 enzyme metabolizes several clinically important drugs, including:
- **Proton pump inhibitors** (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole)
- **Antiplatelet drugs** (e.g., clopidogrel)
- **Certain antidepressants** (e.g., amitriptyline, citalopram)
  
The CYP2C19*35 allele caused by **rs794726721** leads to a *loss of enzymatic function*, classifying carriers as **poor metabolizers** (PMs) if they inherit this variant in a homozygous state or in combination with another nonfunctional variant (e.g., *2 or *3). 

### **Drug Response Implications**
1. **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs):**
   - Poor metabolizers may experience *increased levels* of PPIs, potentially enhancing treatment efficacy for acid-related diseases (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease). However, prolonged exposure might increase the risk of adverse effects.

2. **Clopidogrel:**
   - Poor metabolizers have a reduced ability to convert the prodrug clopidogrel into its active metabolite, leading to *reduced antiplatelet activity*. This increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as stent thrombosis, after procedures like percutaneous coronary interventions.

3. **Antidepressants:**
   - Variants causing poor metabolism may result in *elevated plasma levels* of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), possibly exacerbating side effects or requiring dose adjustments.

### **Clinical Testing and Guidelines**
Genetic testing of **CYP2C19** variants, including rs794726721, is commonly included in pharmacogenetic panels. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (**CPIC**) and other professional organizations provide dosing recommendations for specific drugs based on the patient's CYP2C19 metabolizer status.

If this variant is identified in a patient's genome, clinicians often consider alternative medications or dosing strategies to avoid suboptimal drug responses and reduce the risk of adverse effects.
