The variant **rs796053216** is located in the gene **CYP2B6**, which is part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes responsible for metabolizing a range of drugs. Specifically, CYP2B6 is known to metabolize drugs such as **bupropion**, **efavirenz**, **methadone**, **cyclophosphamide**, and others.

The **rs796053216** variant corresponds to a mutation that causes the amino acid change **Q172H** (glutamine to histidine) and is part of the **CYP2B6*6 haplotype**â€”a well-documented haplotype shown to reduce enzymatic activity. This haplotype includes two key single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): **516G>T (rs3745274, Q172H)** and **785A>G (rs2279343, K262R)**. The presence of these variants can significantly alter drug metabolism and response.

### Effects of rs796053216
1. **Drug Metabolism**:
   - The rs796053216 variant, typically in the context of the *6 haplotype, is associated with **reduced CYP2B6 enzymatic activity**.
   - This reduction impacts the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2B6, often leading to **higher plasma levels of the drug** and increasing the risk of side effects.

2. **Specific Drugs**:
   - **Efavirenz**: Patients carrying the CYP2B6*6 haplotype (including rs796053216) exhibit **slower metabolism** of efavirenz, resulting in higher drug concentrations, which can lead to central nervous system side effects like dizziness, confusion, and vivid dreams.
   - **Bupropion**: The variant is associated with **reduced conversion of bupropion to its active metabolite**, which may lower therapeutic efficacy.
   - **Cyclophosphamide**: The variant may lead to altered activation of this prodrug, potentially affecting treatment outcomes in cancer therapy.

3. **Clinical Implications**:
   - Individuals carrying the rs796053216 variant (primarily in the *6 haplotype context) may require **dose adjustments** for drugs metabolized by CYP2B6.
   - The presence of this variant is also relevant for **pharmacogenomic testing**, as it can help predict drug response or toxicity.

### Summary
Yes, the **rs796053216 variant** influences drug metabolism and response due to its association with reduced CYP2B6 activity. If you are analyzing this variant in a clinical or research setting, you may want to assess its broader haplotype context and consider guidelines, such as those provided by the **Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)**, which offers specific dosing recommendations based on CYP2B6 genotypes.
