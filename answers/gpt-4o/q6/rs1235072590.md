rs1235072590 is a specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human genome. However, information about whether it influences drug metabolism or response depends on its genomic location and the gene or regulatory region it affects. Based on my training cutoff in October 2023, rs1235072590 is not widely mentioned in the literature as a clinically significant pharmacogenomic variant. That said, let's go over how to assess this in more detail:

### Steps to Determine if rs1235072590 Influences Drug Metabolism or Response:
1. **Identify the Gene or Genomic Region of rs1235072590**:
   - Use genomic databases (e.g., dbSNP, Ensembl, NCBI, or UCSC Genome Browser) to determine if this SNP is located in or near a gene implicated in drug metabolism (e.g., genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes such as *CYP2D6*, *CYP3A4*, or genes for drug transporters like *ABCB1*).

2. **Query Pharmacogenetics Databases**:
   - Check specialized pharmacogenomics databases like:
       - [PharmGKB](https://www.pharmgkb.org): A resource that integrates knowledge on the impact of genetic variation on drug response.
       - [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/): A useful tool to check for clinical significance.
       - [CPIC](https://cpicpgx.org): Guidelines for clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics.
       
3. **Literature Review**:
   - Search scientific literature in PubMed or Google Scholar using rs1235072590 as a keyword alongside phrases like "drug metabolism" or "pharmacogenomics."

4. **Functional Annotation**:
   - SNPs may influence drug metabolism if they fall within:
     - **Exonic regions** of drug-metabolism genes (affecting transcript variants or protein function).
     - Regulatory regions (e.g., promoters, enhancers, UTRs) that modulate gene expression.
   - Check functional annotation using tools like RegulomeDB or the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor.

5. **Population Frequencies and Haplotypes**:
   - Understanding the allele frequencies in different populations may provide insight into potential associations with phenotypic variation in drug response.

### Next Steps
If you have specific details about the therapeutic context or the pathway in which this SNP might be involved, it can help narrow down the focus. Otherwise, deeper investigation using the tools and steps listed above will be necessary.
