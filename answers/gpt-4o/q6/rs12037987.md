The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs12037987** is located in the **CYP2C19** gene, which encodes an enzyme that plays a key role in the metabolism of various drugs, including proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., clopidogrel), antidepressants, and other medications. Variants in the CYP2C19 gene are well-known to influence drug metabolism and response.

### Influence of rs12037987 on Drug Metabolism or Response:
1. **CYP2C19 and Drug Metabolism**:
   - The CYP2C19 enzyme is highly polymorphic, and genetic variations can lead to different metabolizer phenotypes:
     - **Poor metabolizers (PMs)**: Little to no enzyme activity.
     - **Intermediate metabolizers (IMs)**: Reduced enzyme activity.
     - **Extensive metabolizers (EMs)**: Normal enzyme activity.
     - **Ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs)**: Increased enzyme activity.
   - rs12037987 is an intronic variant, and while it is not one of the primary functional variants (e.g., *CYP2C19* *2* or *CYP2C19* *17*), it may still have a regulatory role or be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with functional variants that affect enzyme activity.

2. **Potential Impact of rs12037987**:
   - **Regulatory Role**: Some studies suggest that intronic variants like rs12037987 may influence gene expression or splicing, potentially altering enzyme levels.
   - **Linkage Disequilibrium**: rs12037987 may be in LD with functional variants such as *CYP2C19* *2* (loss-of-function) or *CYP2C19* *17* (gain-of-function), which directly affect drug metabolism.
   - **Drug Response**: If rs12037987 is associated with altered CYP2C19 activity, it could influence the efficacy or toxicity of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19. For example:
     - Reduced metabolism of clopidogrel in poor metabolizers can lead to reduced antiplatelet activity and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
     - Increased metabolism of proton pump inhibitors in ultra-rapid metabolizers can lead to reduced therapeutic efficacy.

3. **Clinical Relevance**:
   - The clinical significance of rs12037987 specifically may depend on its relationship with other functional variants in CYP2C19. If it is in LD with key variants, it could serve as a marker for predicting drug response.
   - Pharmacogenomic testing often focuses on well-characterized functional variants like *CYP2C19* *2*, *3*, and *17*. However, rs12037987 could be included in broader genotyping panels to assess its potential contribution.

### Conclusion:
While rs12037987 itself is not a well-characterized functional variant, it may influence drug metabolism or response indirectly through regulatory effects or LD with functional variants in the CYP2C19 gene. Further research or genotyping in the context of specific drugs may clarify its role. If you are considering pharmacogenomic testing, it is important to evaluate the full CYP2C19 haplotype to determine the metabolizer phenotype.
