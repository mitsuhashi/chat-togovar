The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs796053229** is located in the *CYP3A4* gene, which plays a key role in drug metabolism. Though less well-studied compared to other *CYP3A4* variants, rs796053229 (also known by its allele *CYP3A4*⁎22) has been associated with altered enzyme expression and activity. Here's what is known about this variant in terms of drug metabolism and response:

### **Overview of rs796053229 (CYP3A4⁎22):**
1. **Gene Location**: *CYP3A4*, on chromosome 7.
2. **Type of Variant**: A noncoding intronic variant (c.522-191C>T).
3. **Effect**: Decreases *CYP3A4* mRNA expression, leading to reduced enzyme activity.

### **Influence on Drug Metabolism and Response:**
The *CYP3A4* enzyme metabolizes approximately 50% of clinically used drugs, so reduced activity can affect drug clearance and response for many substrates. Studies indicate that individuals carrying the *CYP3A4*⁎22 allele may have slower drug metabolism, resulting in increased plasma concentrations, therapeutic effects, or toxicity of certain drugs.

1. **Drugs Affected by rs796053229:**
   - **Immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus)**: Carriers of the *CYP3A4*⁎22 variant tend to have slower tacrolimus clearance, necessitating dose adjustments.
   - **Statins** (e.g., atorvastatin): The variant has been linked to increased plasma levels, potentially raising the risk of side effects like myopathy.
   - **Calcium channel blockers** (e.g., amlodipine): Reduced metabolism may enhance the drug's pharmacological effect.

2. **Clinical Impact**:
   - Dosage adjustments may be required for patients harboring the rs796053229 variant when treating with *CYP3A4* substrates.
   - It might contribute to interindividual variability in drug responses, particularly with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index.

3. **Pharmacogenetic Guidelines**:
   No formal pharmacogenomic guidelines specifically address rs796053229 yet (e.g., CPIC or PharmGKB), but it is increasingly recognized as a clinically significant variant.

### **Additional Research and Considerations:**
- **Co-inheritance with Other Variants**: Drug metabolism is also affected by variants in other related enzymes (e.g., CYP3A5, CYP2C19) and transporters (e.g., ABCB1). The overall response to drugs depends on the combined effect of all genetic factors.
- **Ethnic Variability**: The frequency of the *CYP3A4*⁎22 variant varies among populations, with higher prevalence in European populations (approximately 5%) and lower in Asian and African populations.

### **Conclusion:**
Yes, rs796053229 (*CYP3A4*⁎22) is known to influence drug metabolism and response, primarily by reducing *CYP3A4* enzyme activity. Clinicians should consider this variant when encountering variable responses or adverse reactions in patients taking *CYP3A4* substrates, especially for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices. Genetic testing might be beneficial for precision dosing in such cases.
