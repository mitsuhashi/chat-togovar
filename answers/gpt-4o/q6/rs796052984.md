The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs796052984** is located in the *CYP3A5* gene, which encodes the cytochrome P450 3A5 enzyme. This enzyme is part of the cytochrome P450 family, which plays a critical role in the metabolism of many drugs.

### Key Information About rs796052984:
- **Variant Type**: rs796052984 is associated with the *CYP3A5* *3* allele (also known as *CYP3A5* *3/*3 when homozygous).
- **Effect**: This SNP results in a splice site variant (c.219-237A>G), leading to the production of a truncated, non-functional CYP3A5 enzyme.
- **Population Frequency**: The *CYP3A5* *3/*3 genotype is more common in individuals of European and Asian ancestry, while individuals of African ancestry are more likely to carry functional *CYP3A5* alleles (*CYP3A5* *1/*1 or *CYP3A5* *1/*3).

### Influence on Drug Metabolism and Response:
The presence of rs796052984 (*CYP3A5* *3/*3 genotype) has significant implications for drug metabolism, particularly for drugs that are substrates of CYP3A5. Individuals with this genotype are considered **poor metabolizers** of CYP3A5 substrates, as they produce little to no functional CYP3A5 enzyme. This can influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of certain drugs, including:

1. **Tacrolimus** (an immunosuppressant used in organ transplantation):
   - Individuals with the *CYP3A5* *3/*3 genotype require lower doses of tacrolimus compared to those with functional *CYP3A5* alleles (*CYP3A5* *1/*1 or *CYP3A5* *1/*3).
   - Poor metabolizers have slower clearance of tacrolimus, leading to higher blood concentrations and an increased risk of toxicity if standard doses are used.

2. **Other CYP3A5 Substrates**:
   - Drugs such as cyclosporine, midazolam, and certain calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine) may also be affected, though the clinical significance varies depending on the drug.

### Clinical Relevance:
- **Pharmacogenetic Testing**: Testing for rs796052984 and other *CYP3A5* variants is recommended in clinical settings where drugs like tacrolimus are prescribed. This allows for personalized dosing to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
- **Guidelines**: The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) provides dosing guidelines for tacrolimus based on *CYP3A5* genotype.

In summary, rs796052984 (*CYP3A5* *3/*3) significantly influences drug metabolism and response, particularly for drugs metabolized by CYP3A5. Pharmacogenetic testing can help guide drug dosing and improve patient outcomes.
