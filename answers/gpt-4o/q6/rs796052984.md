The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs796052984** is known to result in the functional variant **CYP2B6*6**, which influences drug metabolism. This SNP specifically refers to changes in the **CYP2B6** gene, a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 2B6. This enzyme is involved in phase I drug metabolism and is responsible for metabolizing a wide range of drugs, including antidepressants, antiretrovirals, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics.

### Key Implications for Drug Metabolism or Response:
1. **Reduced Enzyme Activity**:
    - The **rs796052984 (G > T)** variant is associated with decreased CYP2B6 enzymatic activity. As a result, individuals carrying the variant allele may have slower metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6.
    - This may lead to higher plasma drug concentrations and prolonged drug action, potentially increasing the risk of side effects or toxicity.

2. **Drug Examples Influenced**:
    - **Efavirenz**: A key drug used in HIV treatment. Carriers of this variant experience slower metabolism, leading to higher efavirenz plasma levels and a greater risk of central nervous system side effects.
    - **Bupropion**: Prescribed for smoking cessation and as an antidepressant. Altered metabolism may result in variations in drug efficacy and safety.
    - **Ketamine**: Metabolism is slower in CYP2B6*6 individuals, potentially impacting anesthetic response.

3. **Pharmacogenomic Testing and Clinical Implications**:
    - Testing for **rs796052984** or the broader CYP2B6*6 haplotype is often recommended when prescribing medications metabolized by CYP2B6. This allows clinicians to tailor drug dosage or choose alternative therapies depending on the individual's genetic profile.

In summary, **rs796052984** significantly influences drug metabolism and response by reducing CYP2B6 activity. Understanding its impact is essential for optimizing pharmacotherapy and minimizing adverse effects, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index such as efavirenz and bupropion.
