rs727504136 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the *CYP2C19* gene. The *CYP2C19* gene encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme that plays an important role in the metabolism of various drugs, including proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole), antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel), and certain antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline and citalopram).

### Clinical significance of rs727504136:
- **Alternate name**: This variant is known as *CYP2C19* p.Arg132Gln (R132Q).
- **Functional effect**: rs727504136 changes a single amino acid in the *CYP2C19* protein from arginine (R) to glutamine (Q) at position 132. Experimental studies suggest this variant significantly reduces or abolishes the enzyme's activity, leading to poor metabolism of certain *CYP2C19* substrates.
- **Phenotype association**: Individuals carrying this variant may exhibit a *poor metabolizer (PM)* phenotype, where *CYP2C19* activity is greatly impaired. This could influence drug response by increasing systemic drug exposure or reducing the formation of active metabolites.
  - For example, poor metabolism of clopidogrel results in reduced conversion to its active metabolite, potentially leading to decreased antiplatelet effectiveness and an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.
  
### Drug metabolism and clinical impact:
- **Clopidogrel metabolism**: Reduced *CYP2C19* function caused by rs727504136 may impair activation of clopidogrel, making alternative treatments (e.g., prasugrel or ticagrelor) recommended for affected individuals.
- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: Poor metabolizers may have slower clearance of PPIs like omeprazole, leading to higher plasma concentrations and increased efficacy at standard doses.
- **Antidepressants**: Altered *CYP2C19* activity impacts the metabolism of certain tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which could require dose adjustments to reduce side effects or improve efficacy.

### Genotyping and clinical guidance:
- rs727504136 is not universally common but has been reported as a rare or ultra-rare variant in certain populations. Genotyping for *CYP2C19* variants, including common loss-of-function alleles (*CYP2C19* *2* and *3*) and rarer variants like rs727504136, can help guide treatment decisions. 
- Clinical guidelines from organizations such as the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) recommend genotype-based dosing protocols for drugs metabolized by *CYP2C19*.

### Conclusion:
Yes, rs727504136 affects drug metabolism and response. Carriers of this rare variant may show impaired *CYP2C19* enzyme activity, influencing the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes of drugs metabolized by *CYP2C19*. Genetic testing and pharmacogenomic guidance can help optimize treatment in affected individuals.
