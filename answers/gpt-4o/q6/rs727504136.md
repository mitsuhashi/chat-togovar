The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs727504136** is located in the *CYP2C19* gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of various drugs. This specific variant is also known as **CYP2C19*3**, a well-characterized loss-of-function allele. It introduces a premature stop codon (p.W212X), leading to a truncated, nonfunctional enzyme.

### Influence on Drug Metabolism and Response:
1. **Loss-of-Function Effect**: Individuals carrying the *CYP2C19*3 allele have reduced or no enzymatic activity of CYP2C19. This can significantly affect the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP2C19.

2. **Drug Classes Affected**:
   - **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)**: Drugs like omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are metabolized by CYP2C19. Carriers of *CYP2C19*3 may have slower drug clearance, leading to higher plasma concentrations and potentially enhanced therapeutic effects or side effects.
   - **Antiplatelet Agents**: Clopidogrel, a prodrug, requires activation by CYP2C19. Carriers of *CYP2C19*3 may have reduced conversion to the active metabolite, leading to decreased antiplatelet efficacy and an increased risk of cardiovascular events.
   - **Antidepressants**: Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram and sertraline, are metabolized by CYP2C19. Loss-of-function alleles like *CYP2C19*3 may lead to altered drug levels and therapeutic responses.
   - **Antiepileptic Drugs**: Drugs like phenytoin are metabolized by CYP2C19. Carriers of *CYP2C19*3 may have slower metabolism, requiring dose adjustments to avoid toxicity.

3. **Pharmacogenomic Implications**:
   - Individuals with one copy of *CYP2C19*3 (heterozygotes) are classified as **intermediate metabolizers**.
   - Individuals with two copies of *CYP2C19*3 (homozygotes) are classified as **poor metabolizers**.
   - Poor metabolizers may require alternative drugs or adjusted dosing to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.

4. **Population Frequency**:
   - The *CYP2C19*3 allele is most commonly found in East Asian populations, with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of approximately 2â€“9%. It is rare in other populations.

### Clinical Recommendations:
- **Genetic Testing**: Testing for *CYP2C19* variants, including *CYP2C19*3, is recommended before prescribing drugs like clopidogrel or PPIs, especially in populations with a higher prevalence of this allele.
- **Alternative Therapies**: For poor metabolizers, alternative drugs that do not rely on CYP2C19 for metabolism (e.g., prasugrel or ticagrelor instead of clopidogrel) may be considered.

In summary, rs727504136 (*CYP2C19*3) is a clinically significant variant that influences drug metabolism and response, particularly for medications metabolized by CYP2C19. Pharmacogenomic testing can guide personalized treatment strategies.
