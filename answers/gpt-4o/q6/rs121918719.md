The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs121918719** is a well-characterized variant in the **TPMT** (thiopurine S-methyltransferase) gene. This variant is also known as **TPMT*3C**, one of the most clinically significant alleles associated with reduced TPMT enzyme activity. TPMT is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of thiopurine drugs, such as **azathioprine**, **6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)**, and **thioguanine**, which are commonly used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, leukemia, and organ transplantation.

### Influence on Drug Metabolism and Response:
1. **Reduced TPMT Activity**:
   - The rs121918719 variant leads to decreased TPMT enzyme activity. Individuals carrying this variant metabolize thiopurine drugs more slowly, resulting in the accumulation of active thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), which can lead to **toxicity** (e.g., myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity).

2. **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation**:
   - **Homozygous carriers (two copies of the variant)**: These individuals typically have little to no TPMT activity and are at high risk of severe thiopurine toxicity. They require significant dose reductions (e.g., 10-15% of the standard dose) or alternative therapies.
   - **Heterozygous carriers (one copy of the variant)**: These individuals have intermediate TPMT activity and are at moderate risk of toxicity. They may require dose adjustments (e.g., 30-70% of the standard dose).
   - **Wild-type (no variant)**: These individuals have normal TPMT activity and can typically tolerate standard thiopurine doses.

3. **Clinical Implications**:
   - Testing for TPMT variants, including rs121918719, is recommended before initiating thiopurine therapy to guide dosing and reduce the risk of adverse effects.
   - The FDA and other regulatory agencies include pharmacogenomic information about TPMT variants in the drug labels for thiopurines.

### Summary:
The **rs121918719 (TPMT*3C)** variant significantly influences drug metabolism and response to thiopurine medications. Patients with this variant are at increased risk of drug toxicity and require personalized dosing based on their TPMT genotype. Preemptive pharmacogenetic testing is a critical step in optimizing thiopurine therapy.
