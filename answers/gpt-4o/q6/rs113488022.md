The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs113488022** is located in the *CYP2C19* gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of various drugs. Variants in *CYP2C19* are well-known to influence drug metabolism and response, particularly for medications such as proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., clopidogrel), and certain antidepressants (e.g., citalopram).

### Key Points About rs113488022:
1. **Variant Information**: rs113488022 is a missense variant in the *CYP2C19* gene, resulting in an amino acid change in the enzyme. Specifically, it leads to the substitution of one amino acid for another, which may alter the enzyme's function.

2. **Impact on Drug Metabolism**: While rs113488022 is not as commonly studied as other *CYP2C19* variants (e.g., *CYP2C19* *2* or *CYP2C19* *17*), missense variants in this gene can potentially reduce or enhance enzyme activity. This could classify individuals as poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultra-rapid metabolizers, depending on the specific functional impact of the variant.

3. **Clinical Relevance**: If rs113488022 reduces *CYP2C19* enzyme activity, it could lead to altered drug metabolism:
   - **Reduced metabolism**: Drugs like clopidogrel (a prodrug) may not be effectively activated, leading to reduced therapeutic efficacy.
   - **Increased drug levels**: For drugs metabolized to inactive forms (e.g., proton pump inhibitors), reduced metabolism could lead to higher drug levels and increased risk of side effects.

4. **Population Frequency**: The frequency of rs113488022 in different populations may vary, and its clinical significance depends on how common it is and its functional impact.

5. **Functional Studies**: To determine the exact influence of rs113488022 on drug metabolism, functional studies (e.g., enzyme activity assays) and clinical pharmacogenomic studies are needed. If such data are not available, predictions can be made based on the location of the variant and its effect on protein structure and function.

### Recommendations:
- **Genetic Testing**: If rs113488022 is identified in a patient, it may be useful to consult a pharmacogenomics database (e.g., PharmGKB or CPIC guidelines) or a clinical geneticist to interpret its impact on drug metabolism.
- **Drug Selection and Dosing**: For drugs metabolized by *CYP2C19*, consider alternative medications or dose adjustments based on the patient's metabolizer status.
