RSID (Reference SNP ID) **rs113488022** represents a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Whether it influences drug metabolism, drug response, or plays a role in pharmacogenomics depends on the gene in which the SNP is located, its functional impact, and any associations established through research.

To determine whether **rs113488022** specifically influences drug metabolism or response, these steps could help:

1. **Gene Location**: rs113488022 is located in or near a gene. Identifying the gene is crucial since many genes involved in drug metabolism are part of pathways such as the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family, transport proteins (e.g., ABC transporters), or receptors.

2. **Functional Annotation**: Understanding whether this SNP has a functional effect (e.g., altering protein structure, splicing, or expression levels) is essential to determine its impact on drug processing.

3. **Pharmacogenomic Databases**:
   - Use databases like **PharmGKB**, **ClinVar**, or **dbSNP** to explore associations between rs113488022 and drug metabolism or response.
   - Check literature databases like **PubMed** for studies linking rs113488022 with drug efficacy, toxicity, or metabolism.

4. **Known Associations**: If studies have linked rs113488022 to pharmacogenomic traits, the influence might already be documented. However, lack of evidence doesn't mean no effect.

### Next Steps:
- Provide additional details about **rs113488022** (e.g., gene location or context of interest). 
- Alternatively, you could look it up in a pharmacogenomics-specific database like PharmGKB ([https://www.pharmgkb.org/](https://www.pharmgkb.org/)) for more insights about its role in drug metabolism or response.
