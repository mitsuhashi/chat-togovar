The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs121913279**, also known as **BRCA1 c.5946delT** or **BRCA1 5382insC**, is a pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 gene associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. This variant has been widely studied in various populations, including those with ancestry-specific predispositions to hereditary cancers.

However, **rs121913279 is extremely rare or even absent in East Asian populations**, including Japanese individuals. Studies and allele frequency databases, such as the **gnomAD database**, **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**, or other resources specific to Japanese allele frequencies, typically report either **no occurrence of this variant** or an incredibly low frequency in Japanese populations.

### How to Check Allele Frequency:
If you want the most up-to-date and specific data on rs121913279 in Japanese populations, here are the steps you can take:

1. **gnomAD Database**: Visit the [gnomAD browser](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), which compiles genetic variation data from diverse populations. Filter for East Asians and check for rs121913279.
2. **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database)**: Check the allele frequency in Japanese populations at the official HGVD website ([HGVD](http://www.hgvd.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/)).
3. **ToMMo Database**: Investigate ToMMo, a specialized Japanese biobank database, at [ToMMo](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/), which focuses on allele frequencies in the Japanese population.
4. **Research Publications**: Look for published studies specific to BRCA1 variants in Japanese or East Asian cohorts.

If you're seeking medical or genetic counseling for hereditary cancer risks, I recommend consulting with a genetics professional or a clinical database to confirm specific variant details.
