Certainly! To determine the allele frequency of **rs121913279** specifically in Japanese populations, you'd typically refer to genomic databases such as the **1000 Genomes Project**, **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**, or **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)** which have population-specific data.

### Steps to Look Up Allele Frequency of rs121913279:
1. **1000 Genomes Project**:
   - In the **1000 Genomes Project**, you can filter by East Asian populations such as JPT (Japanese in Tokyo).
   - Check the allele frequency for rs121913279 for the JPT population.

2. **gnomAD**:
   - Visit the [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org) website and search for `rs121913279`.
   - Filter for East Asian populations (EAS), which includes data for Japanese individuals.

3. **ToMMo**:
   - The **Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization** specifically focuses on Japanese populations.
   - Visit their database ([ToMMo Variant Browser](https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/)) and search for `rs121913279` to find allele frequencies.

### Additional Considerations
- **rs121913279** is associated with the **BRCA2** gene and is a pathogenic variant related to breast cancer susceptibility. It might be rare or have varying frequencies in different populations.
- If it's not found in databases like 1000 Genomes or gnomAD, it could indicate the allele frequency is very low or absent in those cohorts.
