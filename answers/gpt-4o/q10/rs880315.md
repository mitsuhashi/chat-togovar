To determine whether the genetic variant **rs880315** is associated with a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern, several factors need to be considered, including the context of the trait or disease it's associated with, the specific allele frequency, and experimental or clinical evidence.

### General Considerations for rs880315:
1. **Variant Type**: rs880315 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the **IL6 (Interleukin 6)** gene. IL6 is a cytokine with roles in inflammation, immune responses, and other physiological processes.

2. **Impact**: The inheritance pattern (dominant or recessive) of a variant like rs880315 may depend on its functional consequences, how it affects gene expression or protein function, and whether it contributes to a trait in a heterozygous or homozygous state.

3. **Trait/Disease Association**: If rs880315 is linked to a particular disease or phenotype, studies would need to establish whether carrying one copy of the risk allele is sufficient to influence the trait (dominant) or if two copies are required (recessive).

### How to Determine Dominance or Recessivity:
- If **heterozygous carriers** of the variant (individuals with one copy of the "risk" allele) exhibit the associated phenotype or disease risk, the variant has a **dominant** effect.
- If **homozygous individuals** (carrying two "risk" alleles) are exclusively associated with the phenotype or disease, the variant has a **recessive** effect.

### Suggested Next Steps:
To definitively say whether rs880315 is dominant or recessive, here are some recommendations:
- Research published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or literature linking rs880315 to specific traits or diseases.
- Look at the **allelic effect size** and zygosity information from clinical or population genetics data.
- Investigate databases (e.g., ClinVar, dbSNP, or GWAS Catalog) and study the inheritance modeling used in association studies.
