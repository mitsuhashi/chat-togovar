To determine whether a specific genetic variant like **rs1208662086** is dominant or recessive, you would need detailed information about the following:

1. **Associated phenotype or condition**: What trait, disease, or condition is this variant associated with? The dominance or recessiveness of a variant depends on how it influences the phenotype.

2. **Zygosity and clinical expression**:
   - **Dominant** variants typically cause a phenotype even when only one copy of the variant is present (heterozygous state).
   - **Recessive** variants usually cause a phenotype only when two copies of the variant are present (homozygous state).

3. **Published studies**: Has this variant been experimentally studied or linked to a specific disease or trait? Databases such as ClinVar, gnomAD, or scientific literature might contain information.

4. **Functional data**: Does the variant result in a gain of function, loss of function, or another type of effect? This can influence dominance or recessiveness.

That said, **rs1208662086** does not seem to be a well-known or commonly studied variant based on current databases like dbSNP or ClinVar (as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023). It may be a rare or recently identified variant. To clarify its dominance or recessiveness, I recommend the following:

- Search for **rs1208662086** in databases such as **ClinVar**, **gnomAD**, or **dbSNP** for curated variant information.
- Check scientific literature (e.g., on PubMed) for research studies referencing this variant.
- Consult with a clinical geneticist or laboratory performing genomic interpretation, especially if this is part of a clinical genetic testing report.
  
If you share more context about the variant, such as the associated gene, phenotype, or its zygosity in a specific case, I can help interpret available information!
