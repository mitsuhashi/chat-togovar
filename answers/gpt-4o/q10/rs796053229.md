To determine whether the variant **rs796053229** is dominant or recessive, we need additional information regarding:

1. **Association with a specific phenotype or disease**: Is this variant linked to a particular trait or disorder? If yes, studies need to show whether heterozygosity (one copy of the variant) is enough to express the trait (dominant) or if both copies (homozygosity) are required (recessive).

2. **Population genetics studies**: Functional and clinical studies about rs796053229 would clarify its inheritance mechanism.

### How to check:
- **dbSNP Database**: Search for **rs796053229** in [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) to find known associations and functional studies.
- **ClinVar Database**: Check [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) for its clinical significance and mode of inheritance.
- **Published Literature**: Search PubMed for studies regarding the variantâ€™s penetrance and inheritance pattern.

If you could provide more details about the gene or condition associated with **rs796053229**, I can help interpret it further. Without additional context, I cannot definitively classify it as dominant or recessive.
