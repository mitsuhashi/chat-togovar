The pathogenicity and inheritance pattern (dominant or recessive) of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) such as **rs704341** depends on its functional consequences, its impact on gene expression or protein function, and its association with specific traits or diseases. Let's break this down to address your question:

### Step 1: What is rs704341?
The SNP **rs704341** is a specific genetic variant listed in public databases like [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp). To determine its inheritance pattern or pathogenicity:
- It is important to identify which gene this variant affects.
- Check its functional role (coding, noncoding, regulatory, etc.).
- Look at its annotated clinical or phenotypic associations.

### Step 2: Dominant vs. Recessive Nature
SNPs by themselves usually do not define inheritance patterns unless they directly cause or significantly contribute to a monogenic (Mendelian) trait or disease. The inheritance pattern is decided by:
1. Whether the variant disrupts gene function.
2. The dosage sensitivity of the gene (haploinsufficiency vs. redundancy).
3. How it impacts the phenotype in heterozygous versus homozygous states.

For example:
- **Dominant variant**: A heterozygous change is sufficient to cause phenotypic effects.
- **Recessive variant**: Both alleles (homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations) need to carry the variant for a phenotype to manifest.

### Step 3: Research Database Information
To conclusively categorize rs704341:
- Query **dbSNP**, **ClinVar**, or **GWAS Catalog** for any known association with diseases or traits.
- If rs704341 is reported in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it is likely linked to complex traits with polygenic inheritance, which makes the dominant/recessive classification less applicable.
- If it is listed in ClinVar or other clinical variant databases, inheritance information (if any) would be provided.

### Summary
Without specific details from databases or research articles about its functional impact or clinical relevance, itâ€™s not possible to state definitively if rs704341 is dominant or recessive. Traits associated with SNPs like rs704341 are often **complex** and involve contributions from multiple genetic and environmental factors.

If you provide further information, such as the gene or trait associated with this SNP, I can refine this answer!
