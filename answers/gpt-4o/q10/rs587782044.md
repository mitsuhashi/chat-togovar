To determine whether the genetic variant **rs587782044** is dominant or recessive, we need to analyze its clinical implications, inheritance pattern, and associated phenotype based on available evidence. This variant is tied to the **COL7A1** gene and is associated with **dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB)**, which is a condition affecting the skin and mucous membranes.

### Key Information about rs587782044:
- **Gene**: COL7A1 (Collagen Type VII Alpha 1 Chain)
- **Variant type**: It is a **pathogenic missense variant**, specifically a change in the DNA sequence that alters the protein structure.
- **Clinical significance**: Associated with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
- **Inheritance**: The inheritance pattern of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can be **dominant** (dominant DEB) or **recessive** (recessive DEB), depending on the specific variant in **COL7A1** and the zygosity.

### Determining Dominance or Recessiveness:
For **rs587782044**, the most common clinical context of pathogenic variants in COL7A1 suggests the following:
- **Recessive DEB (RDEB)**: In cases where the variant is present in both copies (homozygous or compound heterozygous), this variant is typically classified as **recessive** (e.g., loss-of-function mutations in both COL7A1 copies cause severe phenotypes in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa).
- **Dominant DEB (DDEB)**: If rs587782044 were to alter protein function in a gain-of-function or dominant-negative manner in a heterozygous state, it could potentially contribute to a **dominant phenotype**, but this is more rare.

---

### Bottom Line:
- **rs587782044** is most commonly associated with **recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB)**, meaning it is a **recessive variant** in most clinical contexts.
- To confirm whether it behaves as dominant or recessive for a specific individual, one needs to look at the zygosity (heterozygous or homozygous) and clinical features of the patient, as well as functional studies.
