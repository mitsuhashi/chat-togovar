The designation **rs1201448391** refers to a specific variant in the human genome indexed in the **dbSNP** (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database) by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). However, **whether it is dominant or recessive is not inherent to its rsID but depends on its functional impact, its location (e.g., coding, regulatory, etc.), and how it interacts with other alleles and phenotypes**.

### Steps to Determine if rs1201448391 is Dominant or Recessive:

1. **Check dbSNP or Public Databases**:
    - Look up rs1201448391 in dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) to find information about its allele frequencies, genomic context, and associated studies, if any.
    - Check whether it is associated with any phenotype or disease. Associated studies may indicate inheritance patterns.

2. **Look into Functional Studies**:
    - If this variant is linked to a specific disease, look at published literature or large-scale genomic studies to determine whether the trait it influences is inherited in a dominant, recessive, or other inheritance pattern (e.g., co-dominant, incomplete dominance, or polygenic).

3. **Variant Impact**:
    - Determine whether rs1201448391 is likely to be **pathogenic**, **benign**, or a **variant of uncertain significance (VUS)** through tools like ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).
    - If rs1201448391 leads to loss-of-function or severe protein changes, it may indicate recessive inheritance (if two copies are needed for manifestation, as in autosomal recessive diseases).

4. **Population and Carrier Data**:
    - Examine allele frequency data. For diseases with recessive inheritance, pathogenic variants may be rare, while heterozygous carriers may show no phenotype.
    - If the variant shows phenotypes in heterozygous carriers, it may suggest dominant inheritance.

### Need Specific Information
Without additional context (genomic location, associated traits, or studies), itâ€™s not possible to label rs1201448391 strictly as "dominant" or "recessive." Please provide more information about the variant's context, such as:
- Is it linked to a specific disease or trait?
- Are there published studies or functional data on the variant?
