The genomic variant labeled **rs794726784** is a specific identifier in the dbSNP database. To determine whether it acts as "dominant" or "recessive," we need to analyze information related to its associated gene, inheritance patterns, clinical significance, and impact on phenotype.

### How to Find Out:
1. **Check Functional and Clinical Significance**:
   - Use resources like ClinVar or dbSNP to examine the reported clinical significance of rs794726784. These databases often provide details of whether the variant causes a condition and whether it is associated with dominant or recessive inheritance.

2. **Examine the Associated Condition**:
   - If rs794726784 is linked to a disease/trait, the mode of inheritance for that condition (e.g., **autosomal dominant**, **autosomal recessive**, **X-linked**) will typically determine whether the variant acts dominantly or recessively.

3. **Gene Context**:
   - Determine which gene the variant resides in and assess its functionâ€”some genes are more commonly associated with dominant or recessive conditions depending on whether one or two alleles are required to manifest a phenotype.

### Initial Analysis of rs794726784:
When searched, rs794726784 is known as a pathogenic variant in the **RYR1** gene, according to resources like **ClinVar**. RYR1 encodes the ryanodine receptor 1, which is associated with conditions such as:
   - **Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility (MHS1)**: Typically associated with autosomal **dominant** inheritance.
   - **Congenital Myopathies (e.g., Central Core Disease)**: Can exhibit **recessive** or **dominant** inheritance depending on the mutation and context.

#### Conclusion:
- rs794726784 is likely **dominant** in the context of **malignant hyperthermia susceptibility**, as one pathogenic allele is sufficient to confer risk.
- However, it may behave differently (e.g., **recessive** inheritance) in other associated conditions like congenital myopathies.
