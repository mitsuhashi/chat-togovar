To determine whether the **rs1170153450** variant is associated with a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern, we need to consider:

1. **Gene and Variant Location**: Which gene is this variant located in? Does this gene influence a trait or disease that would define the inheritance pattern?

2. **Clinical or Functional Studies**: What do research studies or clinical data say about the impact of this variant? Are carriers (heterozygous individuals) affected, or does the trait or condition only appear when the variant is present in both copies of the gene (homozygous state)?

3. **Population and Disease Context**: Has this variant been observed in studies of specific diseases or traits? If so, is there evidence that it follows a dominant or recessive pattern in those contexts?

### Steps to Find the Information:

To answer your question specifically:
- Review a variant database like **ClinVar**, **dbSNP**, or **gnomAD** for annotations about rs1170153450.
- Check whether the variant has been linked to any condition and whether it is classified as pathogenic, benign, or of unknown significance.
- Look in the literature (e.g., PubMed) for functional studies or case reports providing evidence about whether carriers of one copy (heterozygous) exhibit symptoms (dominant) or if two copies are required to express the trait (recessive).

### What You Can Do:
You can search authoritative databases (e.g., **ClinVar** or **dbSNP**) or provide more context (e.g., associated diseases, gene name, etc.) for me to offer a more focused answer.

Would you like help with a direct search? If so, providing further details (like the gene name or associated condition) will allow for a more thorough investigation.
