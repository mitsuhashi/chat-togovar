The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs34637584** is a specific genetic variant located in the *SERPINA1* gene. This variant is associated with the **Z allele** of the *SERPINA1* gene, which encodes a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). A deficiency in AAT can lead to **alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)**, a condition that increases the risk of developing lung diseases, such as emphysema, and liver disease.

### Dominance or Recessiveness:
The clinical effect of rs34637584 depends on whether it is present in heterozygous or homozygous form and is typically considered **co-dominant**:

- **Heterozygous individuals (Z/M genotype)**: Carry one Z allele and one normal M allele. They generally have moderately reduced AAT levels, and their risk of AATD-related diseases is lower but not absent.
  
- **Homozygous individuals (Z/Z genotype)**: Carry two Z alleles. These individuals have severely reduced AAT levels and are at significantly higher risk for AATD-related diseases (e.g., emphysema at a younger age).
  
- **Compound heterozygotes (e.g., Z/S)**: Individuals with one Z allele and another disease-associated allele (e.g., S allele) also have reduced AAT levels and may develop AATD, though the severity depends on the specific combination of alleles.

### Summary:
rs34637584 (the Z allele) shows **co-dominant inheritance**:
- In heterozygous carriers, the phenotype can be mild or moderate.
- In homozygous or compound heterozygous carriers, the phenotype is more severe, leading to significant disease risk.
