rs794727152 is a specific reference SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) identifier in the **dbSNP** database. However, the classification of a variant as dominant or recessive depends on its context: the gene in which it occurs, the specific condition it is associated with, and how the variant affects the gene's function.

Hereâ€™s how you can determine whether it is dominant or recessive:

1. **Check the Clinical Significance**:   
   Look up rs794727152 in genetic databases like **ClinVar** or **dbSNP** to determine its associated condition and inheritance pattern, if available.

2. **Gene and Variant Effect**:  
   Examine the gene where the variant is located. Is it a loss-of-function (LoF) variant, gain-of-function, or something else? Many LoF variants are associated with recessive traits, while gain-of-function variants are often dominant.

3. **Condition and Mechanism**:  
   Specific conditions have inheritance modes. For example:
   - If one copy of the variant (heterozygous) leads to disease manifestation, it is likely **dominant**.
   - If two copies of the variant (homozygous) are required for the condition, it is likely **recessive**.

### Specific Data for rs794727152:
This SNP has been described as pathogenic in association with **cystic fibrosis (CF)** in the **CFTR** gene. In cystic fibrosis, inheritance is **autosomal recessive**. Therefore, **rs794727152 is typically associated with a recessive condition**. This means that individuals with one copy of this variant (heterozygous carriers) are usually asymptomatic, while individuals with two copies (homozygous) or compound heterozygous variants in CFTR generally manifest the disease.

For a more detailed confirmation, consult updated databases like **ClinVar**, **HGMD**, or functional studies explaining the variant's pathogenicity and inheritance mode.
