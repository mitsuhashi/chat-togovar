To determine whether the variant **rs1235072590** is dominant or recessive, multiple layers of information need to be considered, as this classification depends on a combination of:

1. **Gene and Disease Context**: What gene is affected by this variant, and what is the trait, condition, or disease that it may contribute to?

2. **Functional Effect**: Does the variant on rs1235072590 lead to a gain-of-function, loss-of-function, or altered gene/protein expression?

3. **Inheritance Pattern**: Understanding inheritance patterns (from family studies, pedigrees, or population genetics studies) can indicate whether the variant shows dominant or recessive behavior.

4. **Research Evidence**: Any clinical studies or experimental evidence linking the variant to specific traits or conditions.

### Steps You Can Take to Find This:
- **Look it up in genetic variant databases**: 
   - **dbSNP** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp): To see population frequency and basic information about the variant.
   - **ClinVar** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar): To check if it has been associated with a known condition and its inheritance pattern.
   - **gnomAD** (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/): For population frequency and possible pathogenicity.

- **Check the associated gene**: Use databases like GeneCards or OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) to investigate the function and associated conditions of the affected gene. This can provide clues about how the variant acts (e.g., dominant or recessive traits).

- **Clinical and Literature Review**: If rs1235072590 has been studied, academic papers or case studies may describe its role in specific phenotypes and inheritance patterns.

### Final Answer
Without further contextual information about **rs1235072590**, such as the affected gene, phenotype, and existing research, it is impossible to definitively classify this variant as dominant or recessive.
