To determine whether the **rs113488022** variant is associated with a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern, more context is required. Specifically, this depends on:

1. **The Gene and Condition:** Variants usually act within the context of the gene in which they occur and the condition or phenotype they may cause. In some cases, a variant can exhibit different inheritance patterns depending on the specific condition.

2. **Functional Impact:** A variant's effect on protein function (e.g., loss-of-function or gain-of-function) can influence inheritance patterns. For example:
   - If one copy of the variant (heterozygous) is enough to cause an effect, the variant may be considered dominant.
   - If two copies (homozygous or compound heterozygous) are required for the effect, the variant is recessive.

3. **Population and Phenotypic Data:** Databases like ClinVar, gnomAD, or scientific publications provide insight into whether a variant has been associated with a specific inheritance pattern.

### How to Further Investigate rs113488022
1. **Look it up in databases:**
   - **ClinVar:** Has this variant been reported in association with a specific condition? Data here may clarify its inheritance pattern.
   - **gnomAD:** What is the allele frequency in different populations? A very rare variant might be more likely pathogenic, while common variants are often benign.
   - **OMIM or Gene-Specific Databases:** These resources can provide insights into the gene associated with the variant and its typical inheritance patterns.

2. **Literature Review:** Scientific papers may have studied this specific variant or variants in the same gene.

3. **Functional Studies and Segregation Analysis:** If linked to disease, segregation analysis within families can confirm whether the trait follows a dominant or recessive pattern.
