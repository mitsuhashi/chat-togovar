The genetic variant **rs121913279** refers to a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with the condition **Marfan syndrome**. It is located in the **FBN1 gene (fibrillin-1)**, which is crucial for the structural integrity of connective tissue.

This variant (specifically the c.487G>A, p.Cys163Tyr change in FBN1) is classified as **pathogenic** and typically follows an **autosomal dominant inheritance pattern**. Marfan syndrome itself is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning that a single copy of the pathogenic variant in one of the two FBN1 gene copies is sufficient to cause the condition in affected individuals.

### Summary:
**rs121913279** is associated with a **dominant variant**, as it causes Marfan syndrome in an autosomal dominant manner.
