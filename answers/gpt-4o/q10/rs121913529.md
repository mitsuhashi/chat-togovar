The variant **rs121913529** is associated with **Marfan syndrome (MFS)**, a genetic disorder that primarily affects connective tissue and has an autosomal **dominant** inheritance pattern. This variant specifically refers to a mutation in the **FBN1** gene, which encodes fibrillin-1, a critical protein in connective tissue structure. 

Since Marfan syndrome follows an autosomal dominant pattern, a single copy of this variant (from either parent) is typically sufficient to cause the condition. Therefore, **rs121913529 is a dominant variant** in the context of its association with Marfan syndrome.
