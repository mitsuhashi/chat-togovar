To determine whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs745774658** is a dominant or recessive variant requires context regarding its associated phenotype, inheritance pattern, and functional studies. This cannot solely be inferred from the rsID without additional supporting data.

Hereâ€™s how you can figure out its inheritance pattern:

1. **Identify its associated phenotype:** Check whether rs745774658 has been linked to a disease or trait. Databases like ClinVar, dbSNP, or GWAS Catalog may provide this information, along with whether it is classified as pathogenic, benign, or uncertain in significance.

2. **Inheritance pattern in reported cases:** Look for studies in population databases like gnomAD, clinical databases like ClinVar, or specific scientific literature in PubMed. These might state whether the phenotype manifests in heterozygous carriers (suggesting a dominant effect) or only when both copies of the allele are present (suggesting recessive inheritance).

3. **Functional studies and impact:** Variants can have different impacts based on their location (e.g., coding, noncoding, regulatory region), type (e.g., missense, nonsense, synonymous), and whether they lead to a loss or gain of function. Loss-of-function variants often result in recessive phenotypes unless haploinsufficiency (where one working copy is inadequate) makes the trait dominant.

4. **Population allele frequency:** Variants common in the general population are less likely to follow dominant inheritance for severe phenotypes. Analysis of allele frequency in population databases like gnomAD can provide clues.

5. **Consult a clinician or geneticist:** If the variant is associated with a medical condition and you are seeking to understand its significance, interpretation by a professional based on diagnostic testing is recommended.
