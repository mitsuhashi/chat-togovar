The classification of a specific variant, such as **rs1489788269**, as "dominant" or "recessive" depends not only on the variant itself but also on the context of the gene it affects and the phenotype (trait or disorder) it is associated with. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) like rs1489788269 alone don't inherently have a dominance classification unless they are linked to a phenotype and that phenotype's inheritance pattern is well characterized.

To determine whether rs1489788269 is associated with a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern, the following steps can be taken:

### Steps to Investigate rs1489788269:
1. **Database Lookup**: Check public allele frequency and disease databases such as:
   - [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)
   - [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)
   - [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)
   - [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/)
2. **Check Gene Information**: Investigate which gene the variant is in or near. Some genes are associated with dominant disorders, while others are recessive depending on the type of mutation.
3. **Phenotype Information**: If phenotype or disease information is linked to the variant, review inheritance patterns from published studies or case reports.
4. **Variant Effect**: Determine if it is a missense, nonsense, synonymous, or regulatory variant. Variants with strong functional impacts (e.g., nonsense mutations that cause loss of function) may indicate dominant negative effects or haploinsufficiency, whereas others may suggest recessive inheritance requiring two copies.

### Quick Action:
If you're analyzing this variant, I recommend starting with the **dbSNP entry for rs1489788269** and cross-checking it in **ClinVar** or **gnomAD**. If no information is available, laboratory studies or family inheritance studies may be necessary to classify it further.
