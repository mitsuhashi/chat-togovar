The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs121913529** is associated with the gene **BRCA1**, a key gene involved in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes. This specific variant (commonly referred to as **c.5266dupC**, previously known as **5382insC**) is a **pathogenic mutation** commonly observed in certain populations, particularly in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.

When asking about the **allele frequency of rs121913529** in Japanese populations, published research and population genome databases like the following may be helpful:

1. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**: This is a frequently used resource for allele frequency information across various global populations, including East Asians (a group that includes Japanese individuals).

2. **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database)**: A database dedicated to Japanese genetic variation, which can provide population-specific allele frequencies.

3. **Literature**: Studies on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Japanese individuals have reported very low frequencies of this mutation, as it is not common in East Asian populations.

### Frequency Summary for rs121913529 in Japanese populations:
- In the **gnomAD v2.1.1 database**, the variant rs121913529 is **absent** in the **East Asian population**, which includes Japanese, Korean, and Chinese individuals.
- In datasets specific to Japanese populations (**HGVD, ToMMo 8.3K Japanese reference panel**), this mutation is generally not reported, indicating a **very low or absent allele frequency**.

### Conclusion:
The SNP **rs121913529** (c.5266dupC in BRCA1) is exceedingly rare or absent in Japanese populations based on available data from population surveys and research. If you are looking for the most updated or specific information, checking the latest version of **gnomAD**, **HGVD**, or the **ToMMo database** is recommended.
