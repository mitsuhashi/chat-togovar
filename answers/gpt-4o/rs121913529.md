The SNP **rs121913529** is associated with a pathogenic variant in the **BRCA1 gene** (commonly referred to as the c.594-2A>C mutation), which is linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. This variant is very rare and is typically only found in certain individuals or families affected by hereditary cancer syndromes.

To determine the **allele frequency of rs121913529 in Japanese populations**, you would generally need to consult genomic databases specific to human populations. Based on currently available resources:

1. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**:
   - The **allele frequency of rs121913529** is typically very low or absent in large population datasets like gnomAD. When present, it is most often found in individuals who underwent targeted testing for cancer syndromes. Be sure to check the latest data on gnomAD.
   
2. **Japanese Genetic Databases**:
   - Databases like **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)** or **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database)** provide allele frequency data specific to Japanese populations. For rs121913529, its frequency may be reported as zero or extremely rare due to its pathogenic nature and strong association with hereditary cancer cases.

3. **ClinVar**:
   - Submissions to **ClinVar** often include patient-specific data and information about geographic origins. This specific variant is generally reported in the context of clinical or familial studies.

4. **Published Studies**:
   - Studies specific to hereditary cancers in Japanese populations (e.g., BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation screenings) may provide insights into this variant's frequency. For example, you can search for population studies from Japanese cohorts on PubMed or within academic research on BRCA1 mutations.

### How to Check Live Data
To check the most updated allele frequency:
1. Visit the [gnomAD browser](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
2. Check regional genetic variation studies like ToMMo or HGVD.
3. Search rs121913529 within ClinVar for specific population data.

If the allele frequency isn't reported, it's likely because the variant is absent in that population's general cohort or is only found in affected individuals.
