To address your query, the rs880315 variant is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the *HSD17B1* gene on chromosome 17. The *HSD17B1* gene encodes the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, which plays a key role in the metabolism of estrogen. Variants in this gene, including rs880315, have been studied for their potential association with estrogen-dependent disorders, such as breast cancer, endometriosis, and other hormone-related traits.

The rs880315 SNP is a non-coding variant (located in an intronic or regulatory region), and its effects are typically assessed in the context of estrogen activity or estrogen-related disease predisposition. Variants with similar effects would likely be those that are functionally involved in estrogen metabolism, estrogen receptor pathways, or other genes with overlapping estrogenic roles.

### Variants with Similar Effects:

#### 1. **HSD17B1 Gene Variants**
   - **rs605059**: Another SNP in *HSD17B1* that has been studied for its role in estrogenic activity and hormone-dependent cancers. It may influence enzymatic activity or estrogen concentration similar to rs880315.
   - **rs676387**: Located in *HSD17B1*, this variant also affects estrogen metabolism and is examined in breast cancer susceptibility studies.

#### 2. **CYP19A1 (Aromatase) Variants**
The *CYP19A1* gene encodes aromatase, another key enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis. Polymorphisms in this gene have been found to alter estrogen levels and contribute to related phenotypes:
   - **rs4646**: Associated with variations in circulating estrogen levels and studied in the context of breast cancer risk.
   - **rs727479**: Involved in aromatase activity and related to hormone-related disorders.

#### 3. **ESR1 (Estrogen Receptor 1) Variants**
Estrogen receptors mediate the biological effects of estrogen, and polymorphisms in the *ESR1* gene have been linked to similar outcomes:
   - **rs2234693 (PvuII)** and **rs9340799 (XbaI)**: Two common SNPs in *ESR1* associated with breast cancer, osteoporosis, and other estrogen-influenced conditions.
   - **rs3020314**: Located in the regulatory region of *ESR1*, influencing estrogen receptor expression.

#### 4. **HSD17B2 Gene Variants**
The *HSD17B2* gene encodes 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which catalyzes the conversion of active estradiol to less active estrone. Variants in this gene can have physiological effects analogous to *HSD17B1* variants:
   - **rs8191246**: Associated with altered estrogen metabolism and linked to hormone-dependent cancers.

#### 5. **Other Related Variants**
   - **COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase)**: The *COMT* gene encodes an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of catechol estrogens. Variants such as **rs4680 (Val158Met)** alter enzyme activity and can have downstream effects on estrogen levels and cancer susceptibility.

### Mechanistic Overlap
The shared pathway among these variants is their influence on estrogen biosynthesis, metabolism, receptor signaling, or downstream hormonal activity. Variants in these genes don't act in isolation but rather collectively contribute to phenotypic variability in estrogen-related processes.

If you can clarify the context you're asking about (e.g., disease association, estrogen metabolism, cancer risk), I can refine this list further!
