The variant you specified, **rs121918719**, is a pathogenic germline variant in the **TP53** gene. This variant is associated with **Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)**, a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by increased risks for multiple types of early-onset cancers, including sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinomas, and others. Specifically, **rs121918719** results in a **p.Arg337His (R337H)** substitution, in which the arginine at codon 337 is replaced by a histidine. The mutation occurs in the oligomerization domain of the TP53 protein, impairing its normal tumor suppressor functions.

Variants with similar effects to rs121918719 would typically involve:

1. **Other TP53 pathogenic variants**: Many mutations in the TP53 gene disrupt its tumor suppressor function and lead to similar phenotypes, including a predisposition to cancers. These include missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations in functionally important regions of the gene.

2. **Variants within TP53 oligomerization domain**: The **p.Arg337His** (R337H) variant that defines rs121918719 occurs in the *oligomerization domain* of TP53. Other residues in this domain may undergo similar missense variants disrupting its tetramerization and function. Examples include:
   - **p.Gly334Val (G334V)**
   - **p.Gly334Asp (G334D)**
   - **p.Arg337Cys (R337C)**

3. **Pathogenic missense variants in TP53 DNA-binding domain**: The **DNA-binding domain (DBD)** is another critical region of the TP53 protein, and mutations in this domain are frequently observed in cancer. Examples of well-characterized pathogenic variants here include:
   - **p.Arg175His (R175H)**
   - **p.Gly245Ser (G245S)**
   - **p.Arg248Gln (R248Q)**
   - **p.Arg273His (R273H)**
   - **p.Arg282Trp (R282W)**

4. **Hotspot TP53 mutations**: Variants that occur repeatedly in diverse cancers and are of clinical relevance. Many of these are within the aforementioned domains. The **p.Arg337His (R337H)** variant is one of these, particularly in specific populations, such as in Brazilian populations where it arises due to a founder effect.

5. **Germline mutations in other tumor suppressor genes with overlapping LFS-like phenotypes**: Other genes carrying germline mutations can produce a phenotype similar to Li-Fraumeni syndrome. These might include:
   - **CHEK2**: Some pathogenic variants, such as **c.1100delC**, may confer similar cancer risks.
   - **PTEN**: Mutations in this tumor suppressor are associated with Cowden syndrome, with overlapping cancer risks.
   - **CHK1/CHK2 pathway mutations**: Variants in genes affecting DNA damage response signaling may phenocopy effects similar to those seen in TP53.

If you're interested in more specific examples, context (e.g., a population or specific cancer type) may help refine the comparison. Additionally, evaluating such variants often requires functional studies and access to pathogenicity databases like **ClinVar**, **dbSNP**, and **COSMIC**, as well as population-level data from **gnomAD**.
