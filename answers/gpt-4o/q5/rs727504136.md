The variant **rs727504136**, also known as **NM_000059.3(BRCA2):c.2808_2811del (p.Lys936IlefsTer4)**, is a pathogenic genetic change found in the BRCA2 gene. This deletion causes a frameshift in the coding sequence, leading to a premature stop codon at position 4 in the new reading frame (p.Lys936IlefsTer4), which truncates the BRCA2 protein. This loss-of-function variant is strongly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC).

Variants with similar effects are typically **loss-of-function (LOF)** mutations that result in a truncated or nonfunctional BRCA2 protein. These include:

### Types of Similar Variants
1. **Nonsense Variants**:
   - Single nucleotide changes that introduce a premature stop codon.
   - Example: **BRCA2:c.1813C>T (p.Gln605Ter)** – This introduces a premature stop codon (early truncation) and results in a nonfunctional protein.

2. **Frameshift Variants**:
   - Insertions or deletions of nucleotides that shift the coding sequence, leading to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) or a truncated protein.
   - Example: **BRCA2:c.3847_3848del (p.Arg1283LysfsTer2)** – A 2-base pair deletion causing a frameshift and an early stop codon.
   - Another example: **BRCA2:c.5946delT (p.Ser1982ArgfsTer22)** – A single base deletion causing a frameshift and subsequent truncation.

3. **Splice Site/NMD Variants**:
   - Mutations at splice donor or acceptor sites can lead to exon skipping, frameshifts, or the inclusion of intronic sequences, all of which may trigger degradation of the mRNA.
   - Example: **BRCA2:c.68-7T>A** – Disruption of normal splicing, often resulting in frameshift events or premature truncation.

4. **Large Deletions or Rearrangements**:
   - Structural variations resulting in the loss of one or more exons, leading to an incomplete or nonfunctional protein.
   - Example: A whole-exon deletion, such as loss of exon 11, would have an equivalent effect depending on the size and location.

### Common Functional Impacts:
- All these variants disrupt the tumor suppressor function of the BRCA2 protein, impairing its role in DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). This leads to genomic instability and an increased risk for cancers such as breast, ovarian, and others.

### Cross-referencing Pathogenic Variants:
The ClinVar database or tools like COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) may provide additional BRCA2 variants sharing mechanisms (e.g., frameshift or nonsense) similar to **rs727504136**. Such tools allow researchers and clinicians to assess the effects of specific mutations on disease risk.
