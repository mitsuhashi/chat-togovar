The rs794726721 variant, also referred to as NM_000256.3(NF1):c.6792C>A (p.Tyr2264Ter), is a pathogenic variant located in the *NF1* gene, which encodes neurofibromin 1. This variant introduces a premature stop codon leading to a truncation of the protein or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Loss-of-function variants in *NF1* are strongly associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant disorder. 

If we are looking for variants with similar effects, we are specifically looking at variants in *NF1* or other genes with pathogenic influences ascribed to nonsense mutations or truncating variants. Below is an overview of similar variant types:

### 1. **Variants with similar effects within the *NF1* gene**
   Variants in *NF1* causing premature stop codons, frameshifts, or splice site disruptions often lead to loss of function of the neurofibromin protein. Examples:
   - **Nonsense variants**:
     - *NM_000267.3(NF1):c.502C>T (p.Arg168Ter)*
     - *NM_000267.3(NF1):c.1129C>T (p.Gln377Ter)*
   - **Frameshift variants**:
     - *NM_000267.3(NF1):c.1260del (p.Lys420AsnfsTer2)*

These types of pathogenic variants result in phenotypes concordant with Neurofibromatosis type 1. Most are associated with severe disruption of neurofibromin-dependent Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulation.

### 2. **Nonsense or truncating variants in other genes with similar mechanisms of disease**
   Variants in other genes that encode large, tumor-suppressor proteins and exhibit loss-of-function mechanisms (like those seen with *NF1*) include:
   - **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex genes**:
       - *TSC1*: Nonsense variants such as *NM_000368.4:c.1832C>T (p.Arg611Ter)* can lead to Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) by disrupting the *TSC1-TSC2* complex that regulates mTOR signaling.
       - *TSC2*: Frameshift and nonsense variants, such as *NM_000548.4:c.1237C>T (p.Arg413Ter)*, similarly cause TSC due to loss of function.
   - **Other Rasopathies**:
       - Variants in *PTPN11* (Noonan syndrome), *SPRED1* (Legius syndrome), and other genes in the RAS/MAPK pathway may exhibit comparable pathogenic mechanisms, albeit less directly due to nonsense variants.

### 3. **Other considerations: Variants causing haploinsufficiency**
   Haploinsufficiency is the hallmark of disease caused by *NF1* truncating variants. Other disorders caused by haploinsufficiency include:
   - **BRCA1/BRCA2 (Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome)**:
       - Truncating variants, e.g., *BRCA1 c.5266dupC (p.Gln1756ProfsTer74)*.
   - **WT1 (Wilms tumor 1-associated disorders)**:
       - Nonsense variants, such as *NM_024426.6:c.607C>T (p.Gln203Ter)*, cause Denys-Drash syndrome due to loss of protein function.

### Summary
The rs794726721 (p.Tyr2264Ter) variant introduces a premature stop codon in *NF1* and leads to loss of function via truncation or mRNA decay. Similar variants include nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants, particularly in *NF1* or other tumor suppressor genes. These variants, especially those affecting neurofibromin or the broader Ras/MAPK pathway, result in haploinsufficiency-related diseases like NF1 and related conditions.
