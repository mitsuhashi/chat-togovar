The rs113488022 variant is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identified in the human genome. To accurately determine other variants that might have **similar effects** or influence similar biological processes, it would be necessary to examine its genomic location, gene context, functional impact, and associated traits or diseases.

Let’s explore this systematically:

---

### 1. **Basic Characteristics of rs113488022**
   - **Location:** Its chromosomal position and gene of residence (e.g., within coding sequences, regulatory regions, etc.) can reveal its context.
   - **Type of variant:** Whether it is synonymous, missense, nonsense, or a regulatory variant, as these properties greatly impact its function.
   - **Effect:** Information from databases like the ClinVar, dbSNP, or the GWAS Catalog can indicate whether rs113488022 is associated with diseases, phenotypes, or altered protein function.

### 2. **Variants with Similar Effects**
Here’s how we approach finding variants with similar effects:

#### A. **Same Gene**
   - Variants in the same gene as rs113488022 (if known) may have similar effects, especially if they occur in conserved or functional regions. For example:
     - **Nonsense or missense variants** in highly conserved exons of the same gene may disrupt or modulate similar pathways.
     - **Regulatory variants** (e.g., in promoters or enhancers) of the same gene may cause similar changes in gene expression.

#### B. **Pathway-Level Impact**
   - If rs113488022 impacts a specific pathway (e.g., Wnt signaling, inflammation, etc.), variants in other genes within that pathway might exhibit related phenotypic effects. This can be identified through pathway enrichment analysis tools.

#### C. **Functional Similarity**
   - Functional annotations (from databases like the GWAS Catalog, ClinVar, or the Variant Effect Predictor) can help. If rs113488022 affects protein stability, expression, or splicing, other variants with similar predicted effects (in the same or different genes) may exist.

#### D. **Disease Associations**
   - If rs113488022 is implicated in a disease or trait, other SNPs associated with the same condition might exert similar effects. Tools like the NHGRI GWAS Catalog can help identify these.

#### E. **Evolutionary Conservation**
   - Evolutionarily conserved regions suggest functional importance. Variants in similar conserved domains (e.g., coding exons or regulatory binding sites) may have comparable functional consequences.

### 3. **Example Databases and Tools**
If rs113488022’s exact details are limited here, the following genomic resources can help identify analogous variants:
   - **Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP):** Annotates variant effects and finds related variants in the same region or gene.
   - **dbSNP and ClinVar:** Useful for surveying SNPs across populations, with information on pathogenicity and trait association.
   - **PhenoScanner:** Links known variants to specific phenotypes and diseases.
   - **GTEx Portal:** Examines rs113488022's potential expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effects, identifying SNPs with similar expression-modulating activity.
   - **CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion):** Predicts deleteriousness scores for variants and helps identify SNPs with comparable likely impact.
   - **LDlink:** Identifies variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs113488022, many of which may have similar effects.

### 4. **Hypothetical Example**
   - If rs113488022 is a missense variant in the gene **BRCA1** that disrupts DNA repair, another BRCA1 missense variant (e.g., rs80357467) or variants in **BRCA2, PALB2, or RAD51**, which encode proteins in the same repair complex, might exhibit similar effects.
   - If rs113488022 resides in a regulatory region that impacts expression of **IL6** (an inflammatory cytokine), other SNPs in IL6 regulatory elements or SNPs regulating related cytokines (e.g., **IL1B** or **TNF**) could yield similar outcomes.

### Conclusion
Variants with similar effects to rs113488022 can reside in the same gene, upstream in the same pathway, or in functionally analogous regions. Precise comparison requires understanding the biological role and genomic context of rs113488022 and leveraging annotation tools like Ensembl, dbSNP, or ClinVar to find other comparable variants. Providing more details about its location or effect will allow for more targeted information.
