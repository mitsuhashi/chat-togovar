The variant rs796052984 is associated with a mutation in the **PCSK9 gene**, which encodes proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Specifically, this variant corresponds to the PCSK9 p.Arg46Leu (R46L) substitution. This is a **loss-of-function (LoF)** variant in PCSK9, which leads to reduced levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the bloodstream. As a result, this variant has a protective effect against cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease (CAD).

### Variants with Similar Effects as rs796052984
Other **loss-of-function variants in the PCSK9 gene** also result in lower LDL-C levels and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. These variants include:

1. **rs28362286 (p.Y142X)**:
   - A nonsense mutation in PCSK9 that introduces a premature stop codon at position 142.
   - This variant results in a truncated, nonfunctional PCSK9 protein, significantly reducing LDL-C levels.

2. **rs67608943 (p.C679X)**:
   - Another nonsense mutation leading to a premature stop codon at position 679.
   - Results in a nonfunctional PCSK9 protein and substantial decreases in LDL-C levels.

3. **PCSK9 frameshift mutations**:
   - Certain rare frameshift mutations in PCSK9, such as indels that disrupt the proteinâ€™s structure, also lead to its loss of function and have similar effects on LDL-C.

4. **Missense variants with milder LoF effects**:
   - Although rs796052984 (p.R46L) is a missense variant rather than a nonsense or frameshift mutation, it still confers a loss-of-function phenotype due to reduced PCSK9 activity, which is a characteristic shared with these more severe LoF variants.

### Mechanism of Action
Loss-of-function variants in PCSK9 reduce its ability to target the LDL receptor (LDLR) for degradation inside liver cells. As a result, there is an increase in the availability of LDL receptors on cell surfaces, which enhances the clearance of LDL particles from the bloodstream, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.

### Implications for Therapy
The discovery of LoF variants in PCSK9, including rs796052984, has informed the development of **PCSK9 inhibitors**, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs. These therapies mimic the effect of LoF mutations by inhibiting PCSK9 function, resulting in decreased LDL-C levels and reduced cardiovascular risk. Examples include:
- Monoclonal antibodies: Alirocumab and Evolocumab.
- Small interfering RNA (siRNA): Inclisiran.
