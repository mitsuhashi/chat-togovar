The variant **rs762927460** is characterized as a single nucleotide variant found in the human genome. Its specific impacts depend on the genomic context. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, rs762927460 is located in the **MC4R gene (melanocortin 4 receptor)** and is classified as a **missense variant** (amino acid substitution). MC4R is central to the regulation of energy homeostasis, food intake, and body weight. Mutations in this gene have been associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders, making it an important target of research in the genetics of obesity.

This variant replaces **arginine (R)** with **proline (P)** at position **236 of the protein sequence (R236P)**. Variants such as rs762927460 with similar impacts on gene function are typically **missense mutations** in **MC4R**, particularly those located within the protein's functionally significant domains, such as ligand-binding or G-protein-coupling regions. Below are other notable variants that may have similar effects to rs762927460 in the MC4R gene, potentially influencing energy regulation and obesity-related phenotypes:

### 1. **rs121913581 (MC4R R7H)**
   - **Change:** Arginine (R) → Histidine (H) at position 7.
   - **Phenotype:** Associated with **monogenic obesity** due to partial or total loss of function of MC4R.
   - **Function:** Interferes with protein folding or receptor activity, reducing its downstream signaling.

### 2. **rs28932472 (MC4R I251L)**
   - **Change:** Isoleucine (I) → Leucine (L) at position 251.
   - **Phenotype:** May lead to mild obesity or be less damaging functionally.
   - **Function:** Impacts MC4R receptor signaling efficiency or surface expression.

### 3. **rs13447324 (MC4R V103I)**
   - **Change:** Valine (V) → Isoleucine (I) at position 103.
   - **Phenotype:** A protective variant that is associated with **reduced risk of obesity** in certain populations.
   - **Function:** Enhanced receptor function compared to the wild-type allele.

### 4. **rs79783591 (MC4R D90N)**
   - **Change:** Aspartic acid (D) → Asparagine (N) at position 90.
   - **Phenotype:** Associated with **severe early-onset obesity** due to reduced receptor signaling.
   - **Function:** Affects structure and is critical for proper ligand binding.

### 5. **rs5030980 (MC4R R18H)**
   - **Change:** Arginine (R) → Histidine (H) at position 18.
   - **Phenotype:** Seen in individuals with obesity; evidence suggests a partial loss-of-function effect.
   - **Function:** Impaired signaling or altered receptor dynamics.

### General Characteristics of Similar Variants
Missense variants in **MC4R** that impair receptor function generally exhibit effects in one or more of the following ways:
- **Ligand binding deficiency:** Loss of response to α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), the natural ligand for MC4R.
- **Impaired G-protein signaling:** MC4R activates adenylyl cyclase via Gαs, and reduced activity leads to dysregulated appetite control.
- **Reduced surface expression:** Retention of the receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum due to folding defects.
- **Functional haploinsufficiency:** Heterozygous carriers of functionally significant MC4R variants often have intermediate phenotypes, such as increased body weight.

### Functional Studies
Experimental studies such as receptor-binding assays, cAMP response analysis, and computational protein modeling can provide insights into how variants like rs762927460 impair MC4R function. Other similar missense variants disrupting MC4R signaling often show overlapping phenotypic effects, primarily in appetite dysregulation and increased adiposity.
