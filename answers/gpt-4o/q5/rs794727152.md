The variant **rs794727152**, also known as **NM_000518.5(HBB):c.20A>T (p.Glu7Val)** or by its legacy nomenclature **HbS**, is the single nucleotide variant responsible for **sickle cell anemia**. This specific variant occurs in the **HBB** gene (encoding beta-globin) and leads to the substitution of glutamic acid with valine at the sixth amino acid position (historically called position 6 but numbered as position 7 in the current transcript). HbS mutation causes red blood cells to acquire a "sickle" shape under low oxygen, leading to vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, and other complications.

Variants in the **HBB** gene that have **similar effects** to rs794727152 generally disrupt the structure or function of the beta-globin protein and may cause disorders classified as hemoglobinopathies, such as **sickle cell disease** or **beta-thalassemia**, or lead to other structural hemoglobin variants that polymerize or aggregate. Here are notable examples:

---

### **1. HbC (rs33930165, NM_000518.5:c.19G>A, p.Glu7Lys)**
- This variant, similar to HbS, substitutes **glutamic acid** at the same codon with **lysine** (Glu7Lys).
- HbC leads to the production of hemoglobin C, which can form intracellular crystals and lead to milder hemolytic anemia compared to sickle cell disease.
- Compound heterozygosity with HbS (**HbSC disease**) can cause a disease phenotype similar to sickle cell anemia, albeit typically less severe than HbSS.

### **2. HbD-Punjab (rs28362286, NM_000518.5:c.364G>C, p.Glu122Gln)**
- A substitution of **glutamic acid** with **glutamine** at position 121 (historically cited as 122). While typically asymptomatic in heterozygotes, compound heterozygosity with HbS can also lead to a mild to moderate sickle cell disease phenotype.

### **3. HbE (rs33950507, NM_000518.5:c.79G>A, p.Glu27Lys)**
- This variant substitutes **glutamic acid** at position 26 (historically number 27) with **lysine** (Glu27Lys).
- HbE can lead to mild beta-thalassemia symptoms when homozygous or when combined with another beta-globin mutation, such as HbS.

### **4. HbO-Arab (rs33915998, NM_000518.5:c.364G>A, p.Glu122Lys)**
- In this variant, **glutamic acid** is replaced with **lysine** at position 121.
- Like HbD-Punjab, it can cause no symptoms when heterozygous but can result in sickling when co-inherited with HbS.

---

### **5. Beta-thalassemia alleles (various mutations)**
- Mutations causing beta-thalassemia heavily reduce or abolish beta-globin production, leading to an imbalance in the alpha-to-beta chain ratio. 
- Compound heterozygosity of beta-thalassemia mutations with **HbS** results in **HbS/beta-thalassemia**, which varies in severity depending on the residual production of beta-globin.

---

### **6. HbS-Polymerizing Mutations**
Rare HBB variants may independently promote hemoglobin polymerization under low oxygen, mimicking the pathophysiology of HbS. For example:
- **Hb Queens (p.Gln70Val)**: A substitution at codon 70, leading to polymerization.

---

### Shared properties of these variants:
- Like HbS, many involve substitutions of **acidic residues (like glutamic acid)** with **nonpolar residues (valine)** or **basic residues (lysine)**, often altering the electrostatic or structural properties of hemoglobin.
- The clinical severity and pathophysiology vary based on the specific variant and whether it exists in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state (e.g., HbSS, HbSC, HbS/beta-thalassemia).
