The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs1235072590** is relatively uncommon and may not be extensively studied in the current genomics literature. Its effects are likely to depend on the specific genomic region where it is located (e.g., intronic, exonic, regulatory, etc.), the affected gene, and the functional consequences of the change. However, we can provide guidance on how to interpret variants with "similar effects" if we dive deeper into the known annotations of rs1235072590. 

To provide an accurate answer, we need to define what is meant by "similar effects"—are you asking about:

1. **Functional impact** (e.g., loss of function, gain of function, regulatory disruption)?
2. **Phenotypic association** (e.g., association with a particular disease or trait)?
3. **Molecular mechanism** (e.g., splicing disruption, protein coding change, etc.)?

Without knowing these specifics, here’s a broad breakdown of how to identify similar variants:

---

### 1. **Variants with similar functional impacts**
   - If rs1235072590 is a coding region variant associated with a **missense mutation**, then similar variants would be other missense variants in the same gene or in genes involved in the same biological pathway.
   - If it affects **splicing**, you could consider other splice-site variants nearby or elsewhere in the same gene.
   - If rs1235072590 is located in a **regulatory region**, variants in the same enhancer, promoter, or other regulatory regions of the target gene could act similarly.

   **Examples of tools/resources to explore similar functional variants:**
   - The Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) can help identify functional categories of nearby variants.
   - The ClinVar database catalogs variants with confirmed functional effects.
   - Gene-level annotations can be checked to identify related variants.

### 2. **Variants with similar phenotypic associations**
   - If rs1235072590 has been linked to a particular disease or trait (e.g., autoimmune disease, neurological condition, cancer), you may want to look for other variants in genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets that are associated with the same phenotype.
   - Variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1235072590 could have a similar phenotypic effect due to shared inheritance patterns.

   **Examples of tools/resources for phenotype-related exploration:**
   - The GWAS Catalog (an aggregation of published SNP-trait associations) can help you identify variants associated with the same disease or trait.
   - PhenoScanner is a database that allows you to look up phenotypic associations of specific variants.

### 3. **Variants with similar molecular mechanisms**
   - If rs1235072590 is in a specific functional domain of a protein, similar effects might be caused by other variants altering the same functional domain, motif, or structure.
   - If it disrupts binding of transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, or other molecular interactions, variants in the same binding motif or region could have similar effects.

   **Examples of tools/resources to explore molecular mechanisms:**
   - RegulomeDB for regulatory region variants.
   - gnomAD or UniProt to check for annotations on specific protein domains.

### Getting Started: Steps to Identify Similar Variants
1. **Check the rs1235072590 Annotation**  
   Look up rs1235072590 in databases such as [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), Ensembl, or ClinVar to determine which locus it affects, the gene it belongs to, and its predicted functional consequence.

2. **Explore Related Variants Functionally or Phenotypically**  
   Search for other variants in the same gene or nearby regions, or those with overlapping phenotypic associations using tools like GWAS Catalog, ClinVar, or PhenoScanner.

3. **Use Bioinformatics Tools for Prediction**  
   Predict the impacts of similar variants on the same gene using in silico tools like PolyPhen-2, SIFT, or CADD.
