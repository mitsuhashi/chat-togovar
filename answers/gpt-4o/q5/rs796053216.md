The variant **rs796053216** is more commonly associated with a deletion in the *CREBBP* gene, which has been implicated in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder. Mutations that affect the *CREBBP* gene are known to disrupt its role as a transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase, important for regulating gene expression and chromatin remodeling.

If you're looking for other variants with similar effects (i.e., variants that lead to loss of function in the *CREBBP* gene or related pathways), here is a breakdown of related genetic changes:

---

### **1. Other Loss-of-Function (LoF) Mutations in *CREBBP***
Variants in the *CREBBP* gene that share functional similarity to rs796053216 include:
   - **Frameshift mutations**: Short insertions or deletions that disrupt the reading frame of the *CREBBP* gene, often resulting in premature stop codons (e.g., c.2027delA or c.3028_3029delAG).
   - **Nonsense mutations**: Single nucleotide variants that result in premature stop codons (e.g., p.Tyr1463* or p.Gln1525*).
   - **Splice-site mutations**: Variants that disrupt normal splicing of the *CREBBP* transcript (e.g., c.2002+1G>A or c.3008-2A>G).

These mutations typically result in reduced or absent CREBBP protein function, similar to the deletion seen in rs796053216.

### **2. Variants in the *EP300* Gene**
The *EP300* gene encodes p300, another transcriptional coactivator with significant functional overlap with *CREBBP*. Mutations in *EP300* also lead to Rubinstein-Taybi-like syndrome. Variants in *EP300* that have similar effects include:
   - *EP300* deletions or truncating variants.
   - Missense mutations in conserved domains shared by CREBBP and p300, such as the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain or bromodomains.

Because *EP300* and *CREBBP* share structural and functional similarity, loss-of-function mutations in either gene often lead to comparable phenotypes.

### **3. Other Gene Variants in Transcriptional and Epigenetic Regulation**
Mutations in other genes involved in chromatin remodeling may result in effects similar to *CREBBP* disruption:
   - **SMARCB1 and SMARCA4**: Key components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. LoF mutations in these genes can lead to developmental disorders or cancer predisposition.
   - **KAT6A and KAT6B**: Genes encoding histone acetyltransferases with overlapping functions in chromatin regulation.
   - **BRD4**: Involved in recognizing acetylated histones and regulating transcriptional elongation.

### **4. Effect-Equivalent Variants in Tumorigenesis**
Disruptions to *CREBBP* are also implicated in cancers such as lymphomas (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma). Somatic mutations that result in CREBBP LoF frequently affect conserved domains responsible for acetylation. Functionally similar cancer-driving mutations include:
   - Mutations in the HAT domain.
   - Somatic mutations in *EP300*, which may cooperate with *CREBBP* loss to disrupt acetylation homeostasis.

---

### **5. Phenotypically Similar Syndromes**
In terms of clinical effects, genetic variants in *EP300* and other transcriptional regulators (e.g., *ATRX* or *MECP2*) may produce syndromes with overlapping features to Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, such as intellectual disability, craniofacial abnormalities, and growth impairment.
