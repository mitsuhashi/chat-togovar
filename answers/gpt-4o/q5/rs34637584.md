The variant **rs34637584** is a well-studied genetic variant located in the *SERPINA1* gene, which encodes Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT), a protein crucial for protecting lung tissue from damage caused by inflammation. This specific variant results in the **Pi*Z allele**, the most common mutation causing Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD). The Pi*Z allele is associated with a substitution of glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K) at position 342 (Glu342Lys or E342K) in the AAT protein, leading to protein misfolding, polymerization, and reduced secretion of functional AAT from the liver.

Variants with **similar effects to rs34637584** are likely other mutations within the *SERPINA1* gene that impair AAT function or secretion. These variants also increase the risk of AATD and may lead to lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as liver disorders. Here are some examples:

---

### 1. **Pi*S Variant (rs17580)**
   - **Position:** This variant causes a single amino acid substitution, glutamic acid (E) to valine (V) at position 264 (Glu264Val or E264V) in the AAT protein.
   - **Effect:** The Pi*S allele results in moderately reduced AAT serum levels (~60–80% of normal). It is less severe than the Pi*Z mutation but can contribute to AATD when inherited in combination with the Pi*Z allele (*e.g.,* Pi*SZ genotype).
   - **Clinical Presentation:** Individuals with Pi*SZ genotype may have mild to moderate reduction in AAT levels and are at intermediate risk for lung or liver disease.

### 2. **Null Variants (e.g., NullHong Kong or NullQ0amersfoort)**
   - **Definition:** Null variants in *SERPINA1* result in complete loss of AAT production due to mutations causing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, frameshifts, or deletions.
   - **Effect:** Individuals with two null alleles (homozygous) have undetectable AAT levels, leading to severe AATD and very high risk of lung damage.
   - **Examples:**
     - NullHong Kong: A frameshift mutation resulting in no protein production.
     - NullQ0amersfoort: A nonsense mutation causing premature termination of translation.

### 3. **Rare Misfolding Variants (Pi*I, Pi*Z/Null Combinations)**
   - **Pi*I Variant:** A rare missense variant causing AAT misfolding and reduced functionality. Effects are milder compared to Pi*Z.
   - **Pi*Z/Null Genotype:** If Pi*Z is inherited alongside a null allele (e.g., Pi*Z/Null), individuals show greatly reduced AAT levels and risk for more severe disease progression compared to Pi*ZZ.

---

### 4. **Rare Z-like Variants**
These are mutations in *SERPINA1* that behave mechanistically like the Pi*Z allele by causing misfolding and polymerization of the protein, leading to intracellular retention:
   - **Examples:**
     - **Siiyama (Ser53Phe):** Found in East Asia, associated with polymer formation and mild-to-moderate AATD.
     - **Mmalton (Phe52del):** A deletion variant leading to loss of AAT secretion and severe AATD.

---

### 5. **Cis-acting Promoter Variants**
   - Some mutations in the *SERPINA1* promoter region reduce transcription of the gene. While these do not affect protein structure directly, they lower AAT levels and mimic the functional effects of Pi*Z in certain contexts.

---

### Functional Impact and Disease Risk
Variants such as Pi*S, Null alleles, and other Z-like mutations can exacerbate AATD, especially in compound heterozygotes (e.g., Pi*SZ or Pi*Z/Null). The extent of risk for emphysema, COPD, or liver disease depends on the severity of AAT reduction and environmental factors, such as smoking or exposure to pollutants.
