The variant **rs121913529** is a well-known pathogenic mutation in the **BRCA2 gene**. Specifically, it is a **frameshift mutation** described as **c.5946delT** (or sometimes referred to as **6174delT**, depending on the nomenclature). This mutation leads to a truncated (non-functional) BRCA2 protein, which significantly increases the risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. It is particularly notable for its high prevalence in individuals of **Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry**, where it is a founder mutation.

### Variants with Similar Effects to rs121913529
Other variants that share features with **rs121913529** are pathogenic mutations in either **BRCA1** or **BRCA2** that disrupt the respective protein's tumor suppressor function. Generally, these variants:
1. Cause **loss of function** (LoF) of the BRCA genes.
2. Are associated with increased risks of developing cancers, especially **breast, ovarian, prostate**, and sometimes **pancreatic cancer**.

#### Examples of Similar Variants:
1. **BRCA2 c.5266dupC (rs80359550)**:
   - Also known as **6174insC**.
   - Causes a frameshift, leading to a truncated BRCA2 protein.
   - Found as a founder mutation in people of **Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry**.
   - Associated with high risks of breast and ovarian cancer.

2. **BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (rs80357914)**:
   - Also known as **185delAG**.
   - A pathogenic deletion in **BRCA1** that creates a frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon.
   - This is another founder mutation in the **Ashkenazi Jewish population**.
   - Increases susceptibility to breast, ovarian, and other cancers.

3. **BRCA1 c.5266dupC (rs80357671)**:
   - Also referred to as **5382insC**.
   - A frameshift mutation causing truncation in the BRCA1 protein.
   - This variant is commonly seen in individuals of **Eastern European (Ashkenazi) descent**, as well as other populations.
   - Associated with elevated lifetime cancer risks.

4. **BRCA2 c.7558C>T (rs80358981)**:
   - Leads to a premature stop codon (**p.Gln2520Ter**), resulting in truncation of the BRCA2 protein.
   - Reported to be pathogenic with similar cancer risk profiles.

5. **BRCA2 c.771_775del (rs80358960)**:
   - Also causes frameshift and LoF.
   - Linked with increased susceptibility to hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.

6. **PALB2 c.3113G>A (rs180177102)**:
   - While not in BRCA1/2, this nonsense mutation in the **PALB2 gene** causes a truncated PALB2 protein, disrupting its interaction with BRCA2.
   - PALB2 is considered a high-risk cancer gene, akin to BRCA genes, and this variant has also been linked with hereditary breast cancer.

#### Shared Characteristics:
- **Mechanism of Pathogenicity**: Most of these variants are **frameshift, nonsense, or large deletions** that lead to premature truncation of the protein, rendering it non-functional in DNA repair.
- **Clinical Implications**: Individuals with these mutations often have high lifetime cancer risks but may benefit from **enhanced cancer screening** and prevention strategies, such as prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy.
- **Founder Effects**: Many of these mutations are enriched in specific populations due to founder effects, such as Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians, and Icelandic populations.

#### Other High-Risk Cancer Genes:
Mutations in other genes involved in DNA repair, such as **ATM**, **CHEK2**, and **RAD51C/D**, can also lead to increased cancer risks. While not identical to rs121913529 in terms of molecular effect, they act in pathways similar to BRCA1/2, contributing to hereditary cancer syndromes.
