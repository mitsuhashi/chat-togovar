The variant **rs121913529** is a well-studied single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the **BRCA2 gene**, a critical gene involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination. This SNP results in a **C>T substitution** at the DNA level, and it introduces a **nonsense mutation** at the protein level. Specifically, rs121913529 corresponds to the **BRCA2 c.5213G>A** (in the NM_000059 transcript), which leads to the production of a **truncated protein** due to the creation of a premature stop codon (**p.Trp1718Ter, or W1718X**).

### Impact on Transcript Expression:
1. **Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD):**
   - The premature stop codon introduced by rs121913529 occurs in an early exon of the BRCA2 gene. This often triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a cellular mechanism that identifies and degrades mRNAs with premature stop codons to prevent the production of truncated, non-functional, or detrimental proteins.
   - As a result, transcripts harboring the rs121913529 variant are likely reduced in abundance due to degradation by the NMD pathway.

2. **Loss of Functional Protein:**
   - Even if any transcripts escape NMD, the resultant protein is truncated and lacks significant functional domains of BRCA2, such as those responsible for DNA repair. The absence of functional BRCA2 protein severely compromises homologous recombination and genome stability.

3. **Cancer Risk Implications:**
   - rs121913529 is classified as a **pathogenic variant** and is strongly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). The loss of transcript and functional BRCA2 protein caused by this variant contributes to carcinogenesis by increasing genomic instability and the accumulation of DNA damage.

### Summary:
The rs121913529 variant likely leads to reduced transcript expression due to nonsense-mediated decay, and any protein generated is non-functional. This disruption of BRCA2 function is the basis for its pathological role in increased cancer risk.
