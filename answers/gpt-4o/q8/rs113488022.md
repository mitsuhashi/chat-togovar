The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs113488022** could influence transcript expression, depending on its genomic location (e.g., in regulatory regions, exons, introns, or untranslated regions) and functional context. To understand how rs113488022 specifically affects gene expression, we need to consider:

1. **Genomic Location**:
   - If rs113488022 is located in a **promoter** or **enhancer region**, it might disrupt or enhance the binding of transcription factors, altering the transcription of the nearby gene.
   - If it is found in an **intron**, it could affect splicing mechanisms, leading to production of alternative transcripts.
   - If it is in a **coding exon**, it might introduce non-synonymous changes (amino acid substitution) or synonymous changes that could affect mRNA stability or translation efficiency.
   - If located in the **3'UTR**, it might impact binding of microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins, influencing mRNA stability or translation.

2. **Experimental or Functional Studies Evidence**:
   - Some SNPs (including rs113488022) are directly implicated in transcript expression changes via **eQTL** (expression quantitative trait locus) studies, which link variation at the SNP with the expression level of specific transcripts. Databases like GTEx or ENCODE may provide such evidence.

3. **Regulatory Predictions**:
   - Tools like RegulomeDB or HaploReg can predict if rs113488022 is in a regulatory region and assess its potential impact on transcription factor binding or epigenetic marks like histone modifications and DNA methylation.

4. **Population-Specific Effects**:
   - Some SNP effects on transcript expression are context-dependent, influenced by tissue type, developmental stage, and individual genetic background.

5. **Experimental Data**:
   - To confirm the role of rs113488022 in transcript expression, experimental approaches like RNA-seq, luciferase reporter assays, or CRISPR-based perturbation would provide direct evidence.
