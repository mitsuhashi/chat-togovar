Variant **rs121918719** is a well-known pathogenic mutation in the gene **TP53**, which encodes the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Specifically, this is the **c.818G>A (p.Arg273His)** variant, where arginine (Arg, R) at codon 273 is replaced by histidine (His, H). This mutation is highly studied because of its association with cancers and its role in disrupting TP53 function.

Here’s what we know about rs121918719 and its effects on transcript expression:

### 1. **Post-transcriptional impacts**:
The rs121918719 mutation occurs in the coding sequence of the TP53 gene but **does not directly influence transcription levels**, as it does not alter the gene’s promoter or regulatory regions. However, this alteration produces a mutant p53 protein with a dysfunctional DNA-binding domain. This dysfunction can indirectly affect cellular processes, including the expression of downstream targets regulated by p53.

### 2. **Influence on transcriptional regulation of target genes**:
TP53 is a transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and senescence. The p.Arg273His mutation impairs the ability of p53 to bind DNA and activate transcription of its target genes. As a result:
   - The expression of **pro-apoptotic genes** (e.g., BAX, PUMA) and **cell cycle-regulating genes** (e.g., CDKN1A, which encodes p21) is reduced, leading to a loss of proper cell cycle control and apoptotic signaling.
   - The tumor suppressive functions of p53 are effectively compromised, promoting oncogenesis.

### 3. **Mutant p53 gain-of-function phenotypes**:
Interestingly, mutant p53 variants, including the p.Arg273His version, can gain novel "oncogenic" functions separate from wild-type p53. These gain-of-function (GOF) effects can alter global gene expression patterns. For example:
   - Mutant p53 can bind to other transcription factors (e.g., NF-Y, ETS2) and modify transcription programs inappropriately.
   - Mutant p53 has been shown to promote the expression of genes that facilitate cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and survival.

### 4. **Indirect effects on TP53 transcript regulation**:
There is evidence suggesting feedback loops involving mutant p53:
   - Under normal conditions, wild-type p53 activates MDM2, which negatively regulates TP53 by targeting it for degradation. However, mutant p53 is sometimes stabilized (due to defective MDM2 regulation), leading to its accumulation in cells. This increased mutant p53 protein may indirectly influence transcript expression patterns.

### Summary of rs121918719's effect on transcript expression:
- The rs121918719 mutation does not directly affect TP53 *transcript* levels but profoundly alters the transcriptional outcomes of p53-regulated genes.
- Loss of wild-type tumor suppressor activity and the potential gain-of-function effects of mutant p53 disrupt normal cellular gene expression programs, which contributes to cancer progression.
