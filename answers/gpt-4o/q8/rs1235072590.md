In order to understand how the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs1235072590** affects transcript expression, we need additional specific information such as its genomic context, associated gene(s), location within the gene (e.g., intron, exon, promoter, 3'UTR, etc.), and any reported experimental or computational data.

Below are general mechanisms by which a SNP like rs1235072590 may influence transcript expression:

### 1. **Regulatory Element Impact:**
   If the SNP is located in a regulatory region (e.g., promoter, enhancer, or silencer), it could:
   - Alter the binding affinity of transcription factors, enhancing or repressing transcription of the gene.
   - Modify chromatin accessibility, affecting how transcriptional machinery accesses the DNA.
   - Influence histone modification patterns or DNA methylation.

### 2. **Splicing Alteration:**
   If rs1235072590 is within a splice site or splice regulatory region, it could:
   - Lead to alternative splicing events, potentially changing isoform expression levels.
   - Cause exon skipping, intron retention, or inclusion of cryptic splice sites, affecting transcript abundance or structure.

### 3. **mRNA Stability:**
   If the SNP is in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), it could:
   - Disrupt or create binding sites for microRNAs (miRNAs), changing the stability or degradation rate of the transcript.
   - Alter other RNA-binding protein interactions that influence mRNA decay.

### 4. **Post-transcriptional Regulation:**
   If the SNP impacts RNA secondary structure, it could:
   - Affect transcript stability, translation efficiency, or subcellular localization.

### 5. **Coding Region Effects:**
   If rs1235072590 is localized within an exon, it could:
   - Change the coding sequence (causing synonymous, missense, or nonsense mutations).
   - Potentially trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) if it creates a premature stop codon.

### 6. **Intergenic or Long-Distance Effects:**
   If rs1235072590 is intergenic or far from known genes:
   - It could influence enhancer-promoter interactions for nearby genes, affecting transcription at a distance (via mechanisms like chromatin looping).

### 7. **Experimental and Computational Data:**
   Functional studies (e.g., eQTL mapping, RNA-seq, luciferase assays) and computational tools can predict or confirm how rs1235072590 affects gene expression:
   - **Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL):** If rs1235072590 is reported to be an eQTL, it can directly correlate with expression changes in specific tissues or cell types.
   - **Databases like GTEx, RegulomeDB, or dbSNP** can provide insights into the SNP's functional role in gene expression.

### Next Steps for Analysis:
To directly evaluate the effects of rs1235072590:
1. Identify its associated gene(s) or genomic region using databases like dbSNP or Ensembl.
2. Examine its functional annotation using tools such as RegulomeDB or HaploReg.
3. Check for eQTL data in the GTEx portal or similar resources to assess whether the SNP affects gene expression in specific tissues.
4. Investigate published functional studies (if available) to gather experimental evidence on its impact.

If you provide more details about rs1235072590, such as its genomic location or associated genes, I can narrow down its potential impact on transcript expression!
