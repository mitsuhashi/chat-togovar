To determine how the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs763684724** affects transcript expression, detailed study specific to its location, functional effect, and context within the genome is necessary. Below is a general framework to assess or interpret its impact:

### Step 1: Locate rs763684724 Within the Genome
1. **Location Context**:
   - **Coding region**: If the SNP is in an exon, it may alter the amino acid sequence (missense, nonsense) or lead to aberrant transcripts (nonsense-mediated decay).
   - **Non-coding region**: It could affect regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, splice sites, or untranslated regions (UTRs).

2. **Genomic Databases**:
   - Check databases like **dbSNP**, **Ensembl**, or **gnomAD** to get information on its genomic position, reference and alternate alleles, allele frequencies, and nearby genes.

### Step 2: Effects on Transcripts
1. **Splicing Effects**:
   - If the SNP disrupts splice donor/acceptor sites or creates cryptic splice sites, it can lead to altered splicing patterns, exon skipping, intron retention, or production of non-functional transcripts.
   
2. **Regulatory Region Effects**:
   - If the SNP resides in regulatory regions (promoters, enhancers, or UTRs), it could affect **transcription factor binding**, **mRNA stability**, or **translation efficiency**.

3. **Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL)**:
   - Check if rs763684724 has been identified as an **eQTL** for specific genes, by querying resources like **GTEx** or **SNPnexus**. As an eQTL, it may be associated with gene expression changes in certain tissues.

4. **Epigenetic Regulation**:
   - Evaluate if the SNP alters DNA methylation, histone modifications, or chromatin accessibility, impacting gene expression.

### Step 3: Functional Studies
1. **In Silico Predictions**:
   - Use tools like **RegulomeDB**, **SIFT**, **PolyPhen**, or **CADD** to predict the functional relevance of the SNP based on its sequence and conservation.

2. **Experimental Validation**:
   - Experimental studies, such as **RT-PCR**, **RNA-Seq**, or **luciferase reporter assays** in cell lines or tissues carrying each allele, are needed to confirm its impact on transcript expression.

### Step 4: Literature Search
Check the scientific literature for studies involving **rs763684724**, as some SNPs have established roles in specific phenotypes or gene regulation.

#### Conclusion
The exact effect of rs763684724 on transcript expression depends on its specific genomic context and any known functional data from experiments or annotations. If the SNP impacts gene regulation, splicing, or transcript stability, it could significantly influence transcript expression.
