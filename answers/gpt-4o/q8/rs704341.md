rs704341 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the human genome that may influence transcript expression depending on the gene context and the functional impact of the variant. To determine how rs704341 affects transcript expression, one would need to evaluate its location and potential regulatory consequences:

1. **Location and Function:**
   - If rs704341 is located in a **coding region**, it may affect the transcript by altering splicing or stability, potentially through the introduction of a premature stop codon or a splice site alteration.
   - If rs704341 is located in an **untranslated region (UTR)**, it could influence transcript expression by affecting RNA secondary structure, interactions with regulatory proteins, or microRNA binding.
   - If rs704341 occurs in a **promoter or enhancer region**, it may modulate gene expression by altering transcription factor binding affinity.

2. **Regulatory Evidence:**
   - SNPs located in regulatory regions can affect transcription factor binding motifs or chromatin accessibility. Tools like ENCODE, RegulomeDB, or eQTL studies can help identify whether rs704341 is in a regulatory hotspot.
   - Datasets such as the GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) project might provide tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) evidence indicating gene expression changes associated with rs704341.

3. **Potential Mechanisms:**
   - If rs704341 has been linked to changes in alternative splicing, RNA-seq data could be analyzed to detect any differences in isoform expression among individuals carrying different alleles of the SNP.
   - If it is an eQTL, the variant likely affects gene expression levels of nearby genes, with possible downstream implications for protein production and cellular function.

To examine the specific impact of rs704341 on transcript expression:
- Use public bioinformatics tools like Ensembl, dbSNP, or UCSC Genome Browser to determine the SNPâ€™s genomic context.
- Investigate its eQTL associations in databases like GTEx.
- Review existing literature in PubMed or phenotype-genotype association studies.
