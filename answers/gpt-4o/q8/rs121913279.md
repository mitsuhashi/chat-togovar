The single nucleotide variant (SNV) **rs121913279** is associated with the **TP53 gene**, which is a critical tumor suppressor involved in regulating cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. This specific variant is also known as **TP53 R175H**, where an arginine (R) at position 175 is replaced by a histidine (H). It is one of the most well-studied missense mutations in TP53 and is categorized as a **pathogenic mutation**, often found in various cancers.

### Effects of rs121913279 on Transcript Expression
1. **Loss of Tumor Suppressor Function**: 
   - The TP53 R175H mutation disrupts the transcriptional activity of p53, impairing its ability to regulate the expression of downstream target genes involved in processes such as apoptosis, senescence, and DNA repair.
   - Genes typically activated by wild-type p53, such as **CDKN1A (p21)**, **BAX**, or **PUMA**, show reduced expression due to loss of wild-type p53 function.

2. **Dominant-Negative Effect**:
   - The R175H mutation often exhibits a **dominant-negative effect** over the remaining wild-type TP53 allele. If both wild-type and mutant forms of TP53 are present (heterozygous state), the mutant can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein, further reducing transcription of p53 target genes.

3. **Gain-of-Function (GOF) Effects**:
   - Mutant p53 proteins, including R175H, can gain new functions, such as altering gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors or chromatin. These gain-of-function effects can lead to upregulation of genes involved in cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis, such as **VEGF**, **MYC**, or **MMPs** (matrix metalloproteinases).
   - Mutant R175H has been shown to interact with factors like **NF-Y**, **SP1**, and others to modulate transcriptional programs distinct from those regulated by wild-type p53.

4. **Impact on Alternative Splicing and Non-Coding RNAs**:
   - Changes in p53 function can indirectly influence the expression of non-coding RNAs (e.g., microRNAs) and alternative splicing events in TP53-related pathways. Mutant TP53 may modulate expression profiles to favor cancer cell survival.

5. **Cell-Type and Context Dependence**:
   - The impact of rs121913279 on transcript expression can vary depending on the cancer type, specific cellular context, and co-existing genetic or epigenetic alterations.

### Experimental Evidence:
- **Functional Studies**: Experimental models (e.g., cell lines) have confirmed that TP53 R175H leads to defective DNA binding, reduced expression of p53 target genes, and activation of oncogenic transcriptional programs.
- **Transcriptomic Analyses**: RNA-seq studies have shown that cells with TP53 R175H mutations often exhibit unique transcriptomic signatures not seen in cells with wild-type TP53, emphasizing both loss of normal function and gain-of-function effects.

To summarize, rs121913279 drastically alters transcript expression by disrupting normal p53-mediated transcriptional regulation, exerting dominant-negative effects, and sometimes acquiring new oncogenic functions. These changes contribute to its strong association with various cancers.
