The rs876660744 is a reference SNP ID (rsID) that typically corresponds to a specific genetic variant in the human genome catalogued in databases such as dbSNP. To precisely understand how the rs876660744 allele affects the structure and function of genes, one would need to analyze its context within the genome, as the effects of a genetic variant depend on factors such as:

1. **Variant Type**: Is the rs876660744 variant a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), insertion, deletion, or other type of genetic change? SNPs, for example, involve a single base change at a specific position in the DNA sequence.

2. **Gene Location**: 
   - If the rs876660744 variant occurs in a **protein-coding region** (exon), it could result in a synonymous (no change to the protein), missense (change in one amino acid), nonsense (premature stop codon), or other effect that impacts protein structure and function.
   - If it is in a **non-coding region**, it may affect gene regulation, such as transcription factor binding (promoter/enhancer regions), RNA splicing efficiency (intron-exon boundaries), or mRNA stability (3'- and 5'- untranslated regions).

3. **Impact on Function**:
   - The variant could alter the expression level of a gene (upregulation, downregulation, or no change).
   - It might impact the structure of the encoded protein if the change occurs in a functional domain.
   - Importantly, not all genetic variants have functional consequences; many are neutral or have unclear effects.

4. **Known Associations**: The functional impact of rs876660744 may depend on whether it has been linked to specific diseases, traits, or conditions in genetic association studies. Such information might be curated in public or proprietary genetic databases.

To determine the structural and functional consequences of rs876660744 specifically:
- **Database query**: Search databases like dbSNP, ClinVar, or Ensembl for annotations about rs876660744.
- **Bioinformatics analysis**: Predict functional consequences using tools like SIFT, PolyPhen, or MutationTaster.
- **Experimental validation**: Laboratory studies could confirm the biological impact.
