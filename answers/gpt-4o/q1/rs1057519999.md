As of my latest knowledge update in October 2023, the SNP **rs1057519999** does not appear in any widely referenced databases, such as dbSNP, gnomAD, or other genetic repositories. This means it's either a very rare or unpublished variant, or there might be a typographical or reference error in the SNP ID you provided.

If you're looking for its allele frequency in the Japanese population, I recommend checking the following databases for the most accurate and up-to-date information:

1. **dbSNP (Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)**  
   [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)
   
2. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**  
   [ToMMo](https://megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/)  
   The Tohoku Medical Megabank provides genomic data specifically for the Japanese population.

3. **JGA (Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive)**  
   [JGA](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/jga/index-e.html)  
   This archive contains comprehensive information on genetic data for various Japanese cohorts.

4. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**  
   [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)  
   While gnomAD includes data from multiple populations, it also breaks frequencies down by ancestry.

5. **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database)**  
   [HGVD](http://www.hgvd.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/)  
   A database specifically for genetic variation in Japanese populations.

If you couldn't find data from those sources, there is a possibility that the SNP was recently identified and hasn't been included in these databases yet. Alternatively, it may not exist at all under the specific ID you provided. Double-check the SNP identifier or consult the original research or study that mentioned the SNP to get more details.
