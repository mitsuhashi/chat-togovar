The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs794726784 is a specific genetic variation identified within the human genome. However, its specific allele frequency in Japanese populations would typically be found in specialized genomic databases or studies.

To determine the allele frequency of rs794726784 in Japanese populations, you can consult the following resources:

1. **The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)**:
   gnomAD provides allele frequency data across various populations, including East Asian populations (which include Japanese individuals). Visit [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) and search for rs794726784.

2. **The 1000 Genomes Project**:
   The 1000 Genomes Project includes allele frequencies for numerous genetic variants, separated by population group. The East Asian sample includes data from Japanese individuals (JPT). You can query rs794726784 through the [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/) or [1000 Genomes Browser](https://www.internationalgenome.org/).

3. **Japanese-Specific Databases**:
   - **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**: Provides allele frequency data specific to Japanese populations. Visit the official ToMMo database for population genomics data: [ToMMo Genome Browser](https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/).
   - **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database)**: This database is specific to Japanese populations and includes allele frequencies. Visit [HGVD](http://www.hgvd.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/).

4. **dbSNP**:
   The dbSNP database hosted by NCBI includes information about various SNPs, including population frequencies based on multiple sources. Search directly for rs794726784 in [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).

If you're unable to access these resources or find specific frequency details, it could mean the SNP has not been genotyped in sufficient detail for Japanese populations. You may need to consult recent scientific studies or publications in population genomics for more insights.
