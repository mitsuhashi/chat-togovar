Certainly! As of my last update in October 2023, to find the allele frequency of a specific genetic variant like **rs880315** in Japanese populations, you can refer to large public genomic databases such as the following:

1. **dbSNP (Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)**:
   Hosted by NCBI, it provides allele frequencies for different populations, including Japanese, based on data from projects like 1000 Genomes and gnomAD.

   - Visit the dbSNP portal: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)
   - Search for **rs880315**, and check the "Global Frequencies" or "Population Statistics" section for ethnicity-specific frequencies, including data for East Asian or Japanese populations.

2. **1000 Genomes Project**:
   - The 1000 Genomes Project provides genotype data for global populations. The "JPT" (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) group specifically represents Japanese populations.
   - You can visit the website: [https://www.internationalgenome.org/](https://www.internationalgenome.org/) and explore the variant.

3. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**:
   - gnomAD includes data from various global populations, including East Asians. It is an excellent resource for finding allele frequencies in specific populations.
   - Access gnomAD here: [https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)
   - Search for rs880315, and look for the allele frequency in the "East Asian" cohort, which includes Japanese samples.

### Why Can't I Provide Exact Data Here?
Allele frequencies for specific SNPs like rs880315 may vary slightly among databases due to differences in their reference cohorts, data collection methods, and versions. To ensure accuracy, it's better to look up real-time data on these platforms directly.
