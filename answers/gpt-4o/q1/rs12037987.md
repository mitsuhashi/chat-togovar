Certainly! The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) **rs12037987** is a genetic variant that can be analyzed for its allele frequency in various populations, including Japanese populations. To get the most accurate and up-to-date information about allele frequencies, the **dbSNP database (NCBI)** or resources such as the **1000 Genomes Project** or the **GnomAD database** should be consulted.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, hereâ€™s how you can typically find the allele frequency of rs12037987 in Japanese populations:

1. **1000 Genomes Project (Phase 3)**:
   - The 1000 Genomes Project includes allele frequency data for different populations, including East Asians (Japanese in Tokyo [JPT]).
   - Visit the online resource: [1000 Genomes Browser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/tools/1000genomes/) or use the Ensembl browser.

2. **GnomAD Database**:
   - The Genome Aggregation Database (GnomAD) provides allele frequency data across various global populations, including East Asians, which include Japanese individuals.
   - Visit: [GnomAD browser](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).

3. **Example Frequency Data (from reference databases)**:
   The allele frequencies of rs12037987 in Japanese populations are typically grouped within the broader **East Asian (EAS)** category in most databases. For Japanese-specific frequencies:
   - The **JPT (Japanese in Tokyo)** subset in the 1000 Genomes Project is your best bet.
   - **GnomeAsia** or Japan-specific genomic studies such as those from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization may also provide precise insights.

4. **Localized Japanese Databases**:
   Consider databases specific to Japanese populations, such as:
   - The Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA)
   - Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization (ToMMo)

To directly find the frequency, you can search for rs12037987 on any of these platforms by entering the RSID number into the search field. If you need me to guide you through how to access these steps or search, feel free to let me know!
