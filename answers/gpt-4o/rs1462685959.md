Sure! The allele frequency of a specific variant, such as **rs1462685959**, in a population like the Japanese, can often be retrieved from publicly available genomic databases. Here are some steps and references to find this information:

### Databases to Check:
1. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**:
   - Visit the [gnomAD website](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
   - Search for **rs1462685959** in the search bar.
   - Look for the allele frequency under the "Population Frequencies" section, specifically for the "East Asian" population (which includes the Japanese population as a subgroup).

2. **1000 Genomes Project**:
   - The 1000 Genomes Project includes allele frequency data for different populations.
   - The Japanese population is labeled as **JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan)**.
   - You can explore the data through resources like [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/) by searching for **rs1462685959**.

3. **ToMMo 8.3KJPN** (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization):
   - This is a Japanese-specific dataset that provides allele frequencies for variants in the Japanese population.
   - Visit the [ToMMo website](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/) or access the SNV (Single Nucleotide Variant) database hosted by Tohoku University.

### Example Output:
If you cannot locate the variant rs1462685959 on your own, you can provide me additional time to reference specific allele frequency reports. Alternatively, I can guide you step-by-step through familiar population genomics tools if you're working hands-on.
