Certainly! The genetic variant **rs796052984** is relatively rare and may not be well-documented in all population databases. To determine the allele frequency of **rs796052984** in Japanese populations, one typically consults large-scale genomic datasets, such as the following:

1. **Tohoku Medical Megabank (ToMMo)**: This is a database specific to the Japanese population and provides allele frequency data for variants found in Japan.
2. **Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD)**: Another resource tailored for Japanese populations.
3. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**: While not specific to Japanese populations, it provides global allele frequencies, including subpopulation breakdowns (e.g., East Asian).
4. **Japan Biobank** or other national genome projects.

### Steps to Check:
- Navigate to public databases like [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) or resources specific to Japanese populations.
- Search for **rs796052984**.
- Look at the allele frequency in the "East Asian" or "Japanese" subcategory, if available.

### Preliminary Findings:
If youâ€™d like, I can assist you in navigating these databases, but I unfortunately can't access live offline databases directly. If for any reason the variant is absent from population studies, it might be extremely rare or not well-characterized.

If the above sources don't yield useful results, you may need access to medical literature or population-specific genetic studies for additional insightsâ€”let me know how else I can help! ðŸ˜Š
