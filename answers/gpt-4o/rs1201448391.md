The single nucleotide variant (SNV) **rs1201448391** is located in the **RSPH4A gene** (Radial Spoke Head Component 4A), which plays an essential role in cilia function. Genetic changes in this gene are associated with compromised ciliary motility and structure. This SNV is often associated with **Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)**, a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired motility of cilia, leading to improper clearance of mucus and recurrent respiratory infections. Additionally, PCD patients may exhibit situs abnormalities, such as **situs inversus totalis**, due to defects in embryonic nodal cilia function.

The impact of rs1201448391 on the clinical phenotype depends on the specific amino acid substitution it causes (if any) and whether it is homozygous or heterozygous. Changes in RSPH4A often result in **axonemal defects**, particularly in the radial spokes, leading to abnormal ciliary waveform and impaired mucus clearance. Consequently, the clinical presentation of individuals carrying pathogenic variants in this gene typically includes:

1. **Chronic Respiratory Infections**: Caused by the inability of the cilia to effectively clear mucus and debris from the airways.
2. **Bronchiectasis**: Damage and widening of the airways resulting from repeated infections and chronic inflammation.
3. **Situs Abnormalities**: Approximately 50% of individuals with PCD exhibit situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome) due to dysfunction in embryonic cilia determining left-right body asymmetry.
4. **Infertility**: In males, due to immotile sperm, and in females, because of fallopian tube dysfunction caused by defective cilia.

Knowing the exact pathogenicity of rs1201448391 requires examining experimental studies and clinical evidence. If rs1201448391 is classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, its presence in the RSPH4A gene would significantly contribute to developing PCD. However, to fully understand its effect, it is also important to consider additional genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors that may influence the phenotype.
