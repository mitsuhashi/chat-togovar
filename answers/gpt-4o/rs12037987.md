The rs12037987 is a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human genome. To understand how it affects the structure and function of genes, several factors need to be considered, including the genomic location of the SNP (e.g., coding region, promoter region, intron, etc.) and whether it changes the amino acid sequence of a protein or alters gene regulation.

### 1. Location of rs12037987:
- **Coding Region (Exonic SNP):** If rs12037987 is located in a protein-coding region of a gene, it might alter the codon sequence, leading to either a synonymous (no amino acid change) or nonsynonymous (amino acid change) mutation. A nonsynonymous change could affect the protein's structure and function, possibly resulting in altered protein activity or stability.
- **Non-coding Region:** If rs12037987 is located in non-coding regions such as introns, promoters, or enhancers, it could influence gene expression rather than protein structure. For instance:
  - In **promoters or enhancers**, rs12037987 might alter the binding affinity of transcription factors or other regulatory proteins, which would impact the level of mRNA produced by a gene.
  - In **introns**, rs12037987 could affect splicing by creating or disrupting splice sites, leading to alternative splicing patterns. This may result in varied protein isoforms, some of which might be nonfunctional or less efficient.

### 2. Functional Consequences:
- **Gene Expression Changes:** If rs12037987 affects regulatory elements near the gene, it could increase or decrease the expression of that gene. This could have downstream effects on cellular processes where the gene's protein product is involved.
- **Protein Structure and Function:** If rs12037987 alters protein-coding sequences, there could be changes in protein folding, binding affinity, or enzymatic effectiveness.
- **Phenotypic Effects:** Depending on the affected gene and its role in the organism, rs12037987 might be linked to health-related traits or conditions. For instance, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may have identified associations between rs12037987 and particular traits.

### 3. Disease Associations:
To fully understand the effect of rs12037987, researchers typically rely on GWAS to link the SNP with specific diseases or phenotypes. If rs12037987 has been implicated in such studies, functional assays might be performed to validate its biological role.

### Interpretation Tools:
- Databases such as **dbSNP**, **ClinVar**, or **GTex** can provide information on the genomic context and associations of rs12037987.
- Bioinformatics tools like ENSEMBL or Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) can predict the potential impact of the SNP on gene function.
