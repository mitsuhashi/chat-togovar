The single nucleotide variation rs794727152 is located in the **SMAD3** gene on chromosome 15q22.33. Variants in the **SMAD3** gene are associated with clinical phenotypes linked to connective tissue disorders, particularly **Loeys-Dietz syndrome 3 (LDS3)**. LDS is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in connective tissue, which can affect the cardiovascular, skeletal, and craniofacial systems. Specifically, SMAD3 variants, including rs794727152, are often linked to **aortic aneurysms, dissections, craniofacial abnormalities, joint hypermobility, osteoarthritis, and other systemic findings**.

More broadly, **SMAD3** encodes a protein that is a key mediator in the TGF-Î² (transforming growth factor-beta) signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation and plays a vital role in maintaining connective tissue homeostasis. Variants like rs794727152 can lead to a disruption or alteration of this pathway, influencing the phenotype's severity and spectrum.

It's important to note that the specific functional role of rs794727152 should be evaluated based on the type of mutation (e.g., missense, nonsense, etc.), its effect on protein function, and related in silico pathogenicity predictions. Additionally, the clinical impact of this variant may depend on zygosity (heterozygous vs. homozygous state) and interactions with other genetic or environmental factors.

When associated with LDS3, clinical management typically focuses on surveillance for aortic enlargement (e.g., regular imaging of the aorta), management of cardiovascular risks, and other supportive therapies targeting the broader connective tissue disorder. For individuals with rs794727152, consultation with a genetic counselor or clinical geneticist is advised to clarify its contribution to the phenotype and to facilitate family risk assessment.
