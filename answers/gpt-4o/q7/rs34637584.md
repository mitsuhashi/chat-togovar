The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs34637584** refers to a specific genetic variant in the **TYR** gene, which encodes the enzyme **tyrosinase**, involved in melanin biosynthesis. This SNP is well-studied in the context of skin pigmentation, human evolution, and adaptation to varying levels of UV radiation across geographical regions.

### Polymorphic Change in rs34637584
- The rs34637584 variant involves a **C>A substitution** leading to an amino acid change in the tyrosinase protein at position 402: **serine (S) to phenylalanine (F)** (S402F).
- This variant primarily affects the function of tyrosinase in melanin production. The presence of the 402F allele is associated with **lighter pigmentation**, specifically in European populations.

### Evolutionary Background
1. **Origin and Positive Selection**:
   - The 402F (derived) allele likely arose after humans migrated out of Africa.
   - As modern humans moved to areas with lower ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the selective pressure for darker pigmentation diminished. In regions with less UV light, lighter skin was advantageous for efficient Vitamin D synthesis. This created positive selective pressure for alleles like the 402F variant of TYR.

2. **Geographic Distribution**:
   - **402F allele frequency** is highest in populations of **European ancestry**, particularly Northern Europeans, and is much less common in populations of African or East Asian descent.
   - This allele is thought to have spread and achieved high frequency in Europe as part of the evolution of lighter skin pigmentation, along with other pigmentation-related genes like **MC1R** and **OCA2**.

3. **Functional Effects**:
   - The amino acid substitution (S402F) affects the function of tyrosinase by altering its stability or activity. The 402F allele has been associated with **reduced melanin production**, leading to lighter skin, hair color, and possibly eye pigmentation.
   - While the 402F allele confers an adaptive advantage in low UV environments, it may also increase the risk of UV-sensitive conditions, such as **skin cancers** (e.g., melanoma), in high UV environments.

4. **Population History**:
   - The 402F allele was likely one of several pigmentation-related mutations that arose in the last 20,000â€“50,000 years, after humans began migrating into Europe and Central Asia.
   - Genomic evidence supports the hypothesis that this allele was under **strong positive selection**, with changes in allele frequency coinciding with the shift to agriculture, where diets may no longer have provided sufficient Vitamin D (further amplifying the selection for lighter skin).

5. **Pleiotropic Effects**:
   - While the primary selective pressures that influenced the rise of rs34637584 likely involved pigmentation and Vitamin D synthesis, the TYR gene might also have pleiotropic effects related to immunity and oxidative stress in skin cells. These effects are still under investigation.

### Summary
The evolutionary background of **rs34637584** reflects human adaptation to varying UV exposure as humans dispersed out of Africa. This SNP contributed to the evolution of lighter skin in European populations as an adaptation to lower UV environments, driven by selective pressures to optimize melanin production and Vitamin D synthesis. Its presence and high frequency in certain populations underscore the complex interplay of environment, natural selection, and human evolution.
