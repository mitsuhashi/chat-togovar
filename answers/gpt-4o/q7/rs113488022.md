The variant **rs113488022** is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from the human genome. Its evolutionary background can be understood in terms of its allele frequencies across populations, species conservation, and functional impact. To give you a more comprehensive understanding of its origins, let’s break it down step by step:

---

### 1. **Basic Information About rs113488022**
   - **Genomic Location:** rs113488022 resides on chromosome **1** (GRCh38 reference genome).
   - **Alleles:** The SNP involves a nucleotide change (often G>A or A>G, depending on the strand and specific databases).
   - **Associated Gene:** It is located in or near the **KCNA3 gene**, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel expressed predominantly in immune cells.

---

### 2. **Conservation Across Species**
   - The genomic region surrounding rs113488022 may or may not be conserved across species (e.g., primates or vertebrates). Highly conserved regions are often indicative of functional importance.
   - To determine whether rs113488022 is conserved evolutionarily, researchers analyze orthologous sequences in other species such as chimpanzees, mice, and zebrafish. If it varies significantly between species, it may be a relatively recent human-specific variant.

### 3. **Allele Frequencies Across Human Populations**
   - The SNP rs113488022 is found at varying frequencies in global populations (e.g., African, European, South Asian, East Asian, and American populations).
   - From databases such as **gnomAD** or **1000 Genomes**, population-level allele frequencies show whether this SNP is ancient (ancestral) or more recent in evolutionary terms.
     - If the major allele is present across most populations, it suggests it may be ancestral.
     - If the minor allele is more population-specific (e.g., predominantly in East Asians), the variant may have arisen more recently or undergone selective pressure in that group.

---

### 4. **Functional Implications and Selection**
   - Variants in the **KCNA3 gene** have been linked to the regulation of potassium ion channels, which play a crucial role in T-cell activation and immune response. If rs113488022 affects KCNA3 function, it may have been under evolutionary selective pressure, particularly in relation to immune challenges faced by human populations.
   - The functional consequences of rs113488022 (e.g., synonymous/missense, regulatory) influence whether it confers a selective advantage or disadvantage.

---

### 5. **Ancestral and Derived Alleles**
   - Using comparative genomics, researchers analyze the locus in related species such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and Neanderthals.
     - The **ancestral allele** is the variant shared with non-human primates (e.g., chimpanzees).
     - The **derived allele** is the newer mutation specific to the human lineage.
   - If rs113488022 is derived, it represents a mutation that likely arose after humans diverged from other primates approximately 5–7 million years ago.

---

### 6. **Associated Studies and Evidence**
   - Some evolutionary studies may trace this SNP to selective forces such as diet, disease resistance, or environmental adaptation.
   - If rs113488022 is traced to being linked with autoimmune disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis or type 1 diabetes), it might have evolved in the context of balancing immune system sensitivity to infections versus autoimmunity.

### Next Steps for Investigation
If you're looking for more specific data:
   - Check the **dbSNP database** for annotations on rs113488022.
   - Use **phylogenetic tools** to find its conservation score across species.
   - Use population genetics tools like **Ensembl** or **gnomAD** to obtain allele frequency data.
