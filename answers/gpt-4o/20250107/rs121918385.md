The variant **rs121918385** is a specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in the human genome. To find its allele frequency in the Japanese population, one would typically refer to publicly available genomic databases such as:

1. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)** - This database includes allele frequency data for various populations, including East Asians.

2. **1000 Genomes Project** - Provides data on allele frequencies across different populations, including Japanese individuals (JPT: Japanese in Tokyo, Japan).

3. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)** - A resource focused on genomic data specific to Japanese populations. It may have detailed information about the allele frequency of variants such as rs121918385.

4. **dbSNP (Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)** on NCBI - Provides aggregate data from various studies and might include frequency data.

### Steps to Check Data:
1. **gnomAD**:
   - Visit the [gnomAD website](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
   - Search for **rs121918385**.
   - Look specifically for the allele frequency in the "East Asian" subset, which includes Japanese samples.

2. **1000 Genomes Project**:
   - Use the [Ensembl Genome Browser](https://www.ensembl.org) to search for rs121918385.
   - Explore the population allele frequencies under the "Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT)" category.

3. **ToMMo Database**:
   - If you have access, visit the [ToMMo website](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/) to query rs121918385.

4. **dbSNP**:
   - Visit [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
   - Search for rs121918385 to see any population-specific allele frequency information.

### Why Might the Allele Frequency Be Absent?
If databases do not report the frequency of rs121918385 in the Japanese population, it may be due to the rarity of the variant (potentially classified as a pathogenic variant or associated with specific conditions, such as in the case of ClinVar entries).

If you could provide any additional context (e.g., disease association, ClinVar classification), I could assist further!
