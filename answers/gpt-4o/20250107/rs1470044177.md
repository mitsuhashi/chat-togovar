Certainly! However, since I don't have access to real-time databases or research as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I can't provide the exact allele frequency for the SNP **rs1470044177** in Japanese populations. To check this information, you can refer to publicly accessible genomic databases like:

1. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database):** [https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)
2. **dbSNP (NCBI's database):** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)
3. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank):** A database focused on Japanese populations: [https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/)

To find the allele frequency of **rs1470044177** in Japanese or other specific populations:
- Search for the SNP "rs1470044177" on gnomAD or dbSNP.
- Look for population-specific allele frequencies, often under "East Asian" or specific Japanese datasets (e.g., ToMMo or other biobank initiatives like JGVD - Japanese Genome Variation Database).
