As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, I do not have real-time access to specific genomic databases (e.g., dbSNP, gnomAD, 1000 Genomes Project) to retrieve up-to-date allele frequency data for particular variants such as **rs755993756** in Japanese populations or any other global populations.

However, you can look up the allele frequency of **rs755993756** in Japanese (or relevant population data) using the following resources:

1. **dbSNP (Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)**  
   - Visit the dbSNP webpage: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
   - Search for **rs755993756** in the search bar.
   - If frequency data exist in Japanese populations, it may be listed under the population frequency section or refer to linked studies.

2. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**  
   - Go to gnomAD: [https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
   - Search for **rs755993756**.
   - gnomAD provides allele frequencies in various global populations, including East Asian populations, which may include Japanese-specific data.

3. **1000 Genomes Project**  
   - Access data on the 1000 Genomes Browser: [https://www.internationalgenome.org/](https://www.internationalgenome.org/).
   - Search for the allele of interest and browse population frequencies, including East Asian subpopulations (e.g., Japanese).

4. **Japanese-Specific Genomic Databases**
   - **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**: A Japanese reference genome database. [https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/)
   - **JGVD (Japanese Genome Variation Database)**: Available at [https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/content/japanese-genome-variation-database](https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/content/japanese-genome-variation-database).

If you are unable to find the specific allele frequency, it may indicate that the variant is either very rare or not extensively studied in the provided data sets.

Let me know if you have further questions or need help accessing any of these resources!
