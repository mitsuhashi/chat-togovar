Certainly! The allele frequency for the genetic variant **rs104893877** can be found by looking into genetic databases. Allele frequencies often differ between populations, so it's helpful to consult population-specific resources.

For Japanese populations, here are a few steps you can follow to obtain the frequency:

1. **dbSNP (NCBI):**
   - Head to the [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) website.
   - Search for "rs104893877" in the search bar.
   - View the population frequency information, which may include global databases.

2. **1000 Genomes Project:**
   - The [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org) provides allele frequencies specific to different populations, including Japanese populations (JPT - Japanese in Tokyo, Japan).
   - You can look for "rs104893877" in their browser or related tools.

3. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database):**
   - Go to the [gnomAD website](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org).
   - Search for "rs104893877".
   - Check allele frequency data, noting specifically the East Asian population (EAS), which includes Japanese individuals.

4. **Tohoku Medical Megabank (Japanese-specific resource):**
   - The Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization provides detailed allele frequency data specifically for Japanese populations. Visit their database [here](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp).
