Certainly! The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs1799853** is located in the *CYP2C9* gene, which encodes for a liver enzyme involved in drug metabolism. The reference and minor alleles depend on the specific population.

To find allele frequency data specific to Japanese populations, we can look at publicly available genomic databases such as:

-  **The 1000 Genomes Project**  
   In this project, the Japanese population is labeled as "JPT" (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan).

-  **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**  
   gnomAD provides population-specific allele frequencies and typically includes Japanese individuals in its East Asian (EAS) population group.

### Allele Frequency in Japanese Population (JPT)

For **rs1799853 (CYP2C9, also known as *CYP2C9* \*2)**:
- **Reference allele (C)** and **minor allele (T)**.

According to available data from the **1000 Genomes Project (JPT)**:

- **Allele C frequency**: ~0.99 (99%)
- **Allele T frequency**: ~0.01 (1%)

This indicates the **T allele** (associated with reduced enzyme activity) is quite rare in the Japanese population.

### Allele Frequency in East Asian Population (gnomAD)
From gnomAD’s East Asian cohort (includes Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, etc.):
- **Allele C frequency**: ~0.98–0.99
- **Allele T frequency**: ~0.01–0.02

### Clinical Relevance
The *T allele* of rs1799853 (*CYP2C9* \*2) is associated with reduced enzyme activity, potentially affecting drug metabolism, such as for warfarin or phenytoin.
