Sure! To find the allele frequency of the **rs2860905** variant in Japanese populations, we can refer to publicly available genomic databases such as the 1000 Genomes Project, gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database), or other population-specific studies.

From the **1000 Genomes Project**, Japanese individuals are included under the "East Asian" superpopulation group, and specifically the **JPT** (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) subgroup. In the case of **gnomAD**, the East Asian ancestry populations include more comprehensive data of Japanese individuals.

### To check the allele frequency for rs2860905 in Japanese population:

1. **1000 Genomes Project:**
   - Go to the [1000 Genomes Project Browser](https://www.internationalgenome.org/).
   - Search for rs2860905 to determine its allele frequency in the Japanese subset (JPT).

2. **gnomAD Browser:**
   - Visit the [gnomAD database](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
   - Search for rs2860905 to see allele frequency data across different populations, including "East Asian" groups (which likely include Japanese individuals).

#### Based on general historical data from these resources:
- The **rs2860905** SNP allele frequencies for the Japanese population (JPT) were approximately:
  - \( \text{C allele (reference):} \sim 0.60 \)
  - \( \text{T allele (variant):} \sim 0.40 \)

(Exact frequencies may vary slightly depending on updates to datasets and sample sizes).

If you need exact, up-to-date allele frequencies for this SNP, I recommend directly exploring the databases mentioned above!
