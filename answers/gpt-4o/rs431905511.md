The allele frequency of a specific genetic variant, such as **rs431905511**, in any population (e.g., Japanese population) can typically be found in publicly available genomic databases or research studies that report population-specific genetic variations. Unfortunately, I do not have direct access to real-time databases or unpublished information, but I can guide you on how to look it up.

### 1. **dbSNP (Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)**
   - Visit the [dbSNP website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
   - Search for **rs431905511**.
   - If allele frequency data is available, dbSNP will display frequency information for different populations, including data from projects like the 1000 Genomes Project or gnomAD.

### 2. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**
   - Check the [gnomAD browser](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
   - Search for the variant **rs431905511**.
   - gnomAD often provides detailed allele frequency information for various populations, including East Asian populations, which may include Japanese individuals.

### 3. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**
   - The Tohoku Medical Megabank has allele frequency data from the Japanese population. You can search their dataset using their [genome browser or allele frequency database](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/).

### 4. **Human Genomic Variation Database (HGVD)**
   - The HGVD contains genomic data specific to Japanese populations and is maintained by a Japanese research institute. Visit [HGVD](http://www.hgvd.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/).

### 5. **Literature Search**
   - Search for **rs431905511 frequency in Japanese populations** on PubMed ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)) for research articles that may contain more precise information about this variant in the Japanese population.

If you were unable to find the specific information, the genetic variant might not yet be well characterized in Japanese or other populations.
