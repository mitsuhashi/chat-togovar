The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs796053216** is a relatively rare variant, and allele frequency information for such SNPs can sometimes be limited, depending on the population and the dataset used. To find the allele frequency of **rs796053216** in Japanese populations, you would typically consult large-scale genomic databases like the following:

1. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database):**
   - Visit the [gnomAD database](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) and search for **rs796053216**.
   - If the SNP is present, gnomAD provides allele frequencies stratified by population, including the **East Asian** population, which often includes Japanese individuals.

2. **1000 Genomes Project:**
   - The [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/) offers allele frequency data for different populations, including the Japanese population (labeled as **JPT: Japanese in Tokyo, Japan**).
   - You can search for **rs796053216** via their Ensembl or online tools to see its frequency in this group.

3. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization):**
   - The [Japanese MAF database](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/) provides allele frequency data specific to the Japanese population. It’s one of the largest databases for genomic data in Japan.

4. **dbSNP (NCBI):**
   - Visit [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) and search for the RS identifier, **rs796053216**. If the SNP has been studied in Japanese individuals, it may include population-specific allele frequency.

5. **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database):**
   - The [HGVD](http://www.hgvd.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) is a Japanese-specific database that provides allele frequency data for variants based on Japanese cohorts.

### General Steps to Check:
1. Search the SNP in one or more of the above databases using the identifier **rs796053216**.
2. Filter the results for the **Japanese population** or **East Asian population**, as applicable.
3. Compare frequency results from different datasets for better confidence.

If you couldn’t find allele frequency data for rs796053216 in Japanese populations in the mentioned resources, it is possible that this SNP is extremely rare or not well-documented in current genomic studies. Let me know if you'd like detailed guidance on navigating any specific database!
