The rs704341 allele is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that has been studied in the context of human genetics. However, when it comes to understanding how a particular SNP such as rs704341 affects the structure and function of genes, it is largely dependent on the specific genomic context in which the SNP is located and the role of the gene(s) it influences. That said, here is a general explanation, followed by specifics about rs704341 if available.

### General Effects of SNPs like rs704341:
SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide at a specific location in the genome, and their effects can vary based on where they occur:
1. **Non-coding Regions:**
   - **Regulatory Regions:** An SNP in promoter, enhancer, or other regulatory sequences can affect gene expression by altering transcription factor binding or the activity of regulatory elements.
   - **Splice Sites:** If an SNP is near a splice site, it can influence alternative splicing, leading to variations in the final mRNA and protein products.
   - **Non-coding RNA Genes:** SNPs can impact the function of non-coding RNAs, which have regulatory roles.

2. **Coding Regions:**
   - **Synonymous Variants:** SNPs that do not change the encoded amino acid (synonymous) may still affect mRNA stability, folding, or translation efficiency.
   - **Non-synonymous Variants:** SNPs that result in a different amino acid being incorporated into a protein can alter the protein's structure and function.
   - **Premature Stop Codons:** Some SNPs introduce stop codons, creating truncated proteins that may lose function or gain novel effects.

3. **Intronic Regions:** Many SNPs in introns have regulatory effects by affecting RNA splicing or influencing transcription through interactions with enhancer elements.

### Effects of the rs704341 SNP:
The rs704341 SNP is located within the **PVRL2** (poliovirus receptor-related 2) gene on **chromosome 19**, which is in close genomic proximity to the **APOE** (Apolipoprotein E) gene region. This region has significant importance in studies of Alzheimer's disease and lipid metabolism.

- **Association with Disease Risk:** The rs704341 SNP has been associated with lipid traits (e.g., cholesterol levels) and Alzheimer's disease risk, as its effects may be linked with those of the APOE gene through linkage disequilibrium (LD). Linkage disequilibrium means that rs704341 is inherited along with APOE variants that directly influence disease traits.
  
- **Expression Regulation:** The most likely mechanism for rs704341's impact is through regulation of neighboring genes, such as PVRL2 and APOE. It may be part of a haplotype (a set of linked variants), influencing gene expression levels or RNA splicing patterns of the nearby genes.

- **Functional Impact:** Current research indicates that rs704341 itself may not directly alter a protein but could instead indirectly affect pathways by modulating gene expression or being in LD with functional variants in APOE or other genes in the region.

### Summary:
The rs704341 SNP primarily affects the regulatory elements of genes in its genomic neighborhood, such as PVRL2 or APOE. It is most commonly investigated because of its strong association with Alzheimer's disease and lipid metabolism due to its location in a highly relevant region of chromosome 19. Its exact mechanistic role is not fully understood and may involve complex interactions with other genetic variants and environmental factors.
