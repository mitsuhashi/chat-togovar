The specific effects of the rs113488022 allele on the structure and function of genes depend on its genomic location, its associated variant type (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism, insertion, deletion), and any changes it induces in the expression or function of nearby or associated genes. Without detailed information on its location, variant type, and functional studies, the exact impact cannot be stated definitively. However, I can provide a general explanation of how genetic variants such as rs113488022 may exert their effects.

### General Impact of Genetic Variants Like rs113488022:

1. **Coding Region Variants**:
   - If rs113488022 falls within a protein-coding region of a gene, it could alter the gene's function by:
     - **Nonsynonymous (Missense) Mutation**: Changing an amino acid in the protein, possibly affecting protein structure, stability, or function.
     - **Synonymous Mutation**: Not changing the amino acid but potentially affecting mRNA stability or translation efficiency.
     - **Nonsense Mutation**: Introducing a premature stop codon, potentially leading to a truncated, nonfunctional protein.
   
2. **Non-Coding Region Variants**:
   - If rs113488022 is in a non-coding region, it could affect gene expression by:
     - **Promoter/Enhancer Regions**: Altering transcription factor binding or regulatory activity, which can increase or decrease transcription levels.
     - **Intronic Region**: Potentially influencing splicing by disrupting splice sites or creating cryptic splice sites.
     - **3' or 5' UTRs (Untranslated Regions)**: Modifying RNA stability, translation efficiency, or microRNA binding.

3. **Effects on Chromatin Structure**:
   - Some variants may influence chromatin accessibility or histone modifications, thereby altering the active/inactive state of nearby genes.

4. **Regulatory RNA Interaction**:
   - Variants like rs113488022 might impact non-coding RNA molecules (e.g., microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs), which regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally.

### Steps to Determine the Impact of rs113488022:
To understand how rs113488022 specifically impacts genes, questions to investigate include:
- **Genome Location**: In what gene or genomic region is rs113488022 located?
- **Consequence Type**: Is it a missense, synonymous, regulatory, or intronic variant? This can be assessed by tools like Ensembl or dbSNP.
- **Functional Annotation**: What is known from databases (e.g., dbSNP, ClinVar) or research about its functional role in disease or normal biology?
- **Experimental Evidence**: Are there studies (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9 editing, reporter assays) that show how this allele influences molecular or phenotypic outcomes?
