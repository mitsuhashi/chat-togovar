Certainly! The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs34637584** is notably associated with a variant in the **PCSK9** gene, which has drawn attention for its relationship with lipid metabolism and cholesterol regulation.

To find allele frequencies for a specific population — such as Japanese individuals — databases like the following are commonly used:

1. **1000 Genomes Project**: Provides comprehensive data on global allele frequencies, including specific populations like Japanese (JPT: Japanese in Tokyo, Japan).
2. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**: Offers allele frequency data across diverse populations, including East Asians.
3. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**: A specialized database for genomic data, specifically focused on Japanese populations.

### Steps to Obtain the Frequency:
You can search for rs34637584 in one of these databases:

#### 1. **1000 Genomes Project**
   - Browse the [1000 Genomes Browser](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data).
   - Search for rs34637584 and check the allele frequency specifically under the "JPT" population.

#### 2. **gnomAD**
   - Visit the gnomAD Variant Browser ([gnomAD Browser](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)).
   - Enter rs34637584 in the search field, and review frequencies in the "East Asian" population — Japanese frequencies will contribute to this group.

#### 3. **ToMMo Genomic Data**
   - Refer to the [ToMMo Portal](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/).
   - If the SNP is available, it will provide Japan-specific allele frequencies.

If you want a precise allele frequency, I can assist further if you provide me access to specific resources or databases. As of my latest knowledge cutoff in October 2023, allele frequency values may vary depending on the dataset source. Could you clarify which source you'd prefer for cross-verification?
