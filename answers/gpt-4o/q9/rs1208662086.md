To determine if **rs1208662086** can be a target for genome editing using CRISPR, we need to evaluate a few key factors. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### 1. **Is rs1208662086 a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)?**
   - The identifier **rs1208662086** suggests it is a reference SNP (rsID) recorded in the dbSNP database. It is worth verifying the variant type (e.g., single nucleotide change, insertion, or deletion) by looking up the rsID in a database like [NCBI dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
   - If it is an SNP or small indel, it indeed can serve as a potential target for CRISPR editing.

### 2. **Verify the Genomic Location of the Variant**
   - The genomic location of this rsID should be noted (e.g., chromosome number, exact position). This can be found in dbSNP or other genomic resources such as Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser.
   - Knowing the location is critical to design specific CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs). 

### 3. **Target Sequence Feasibility**
   - CRISPR/Cas9 editing requires:
     - A **protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)** near the variant site for the chosen CRISPR system (e.g., Cas9 typically requires NGG as the PAM sequence).
     - A unique sequence (~20 bases) near the SNP to design a guide RNA.
   - The sequence flanking rs1208662086 must be analyzed to ensure these criteria are met.

### 4. **Functional Context of rs1208662086**
   - Does this SNP have a biological significance? For example:
     - Is it in a gene coding region, regulatory element, or intergenic region?
     - Does it affect gene expression, protein function, or molecular binding sites?
   - Understanding if rs1208662086 is linked to functional changes can help decide whether editing it is meaningful for your research or application.

### 5. **Choosing the Genome Editing Tool**
   - If CRISPR-Cas9 or a similar system is suitable for targeting rs1208662086, you can design a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the region around the SNP.
   - Instead of inducing random mutations, you can use CRISPR-based **homology-directed repair (HDR)** to introduce specific changes, or base editing systems to subtly alter the SNP without creating double-strand breaks.

### 6. **Off-Target Effects**
   - Before deploying CRISPR, computational tools like Benchling, CRISPOR, or CHOPCHOP should be used to check for potential **off-target effects** of the gRNA.

### Conclusion:
**Yes, rs1208662086 can likely be a target for CRISPR genome editing**, provided that:
1. A PAM site and a suitable sgRNA can be designed around the target region.
2. The SNP is located in an area that can be accessed by the editing tools.
3. There is a clear biological reason to edit this SNP.
