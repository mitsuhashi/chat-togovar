The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs880315** is located in the human genome. It is a genetic variant within the intronic region of the **ANKRD55 (Ankyrin Repeat Domain 55)** gene, which is of interest due to its potential association with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Notably, **ANKRD55** has been linked to conditions such as:

- **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**
- **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**
- **Type 1 diabetes (T1D)**

**Genomic Context:**
- **Location**: Chromosome 5q11.2
- **Region**: Intron of ANKRD55.

Although rs880315 itself is an intronic SNP, it may influence gene expression or splicing via regulatory mechanisms, such as altering enhancer activity, transcription factor binding, or long-range chromatin interactions. Functional studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that variants in this region, including rs880315, may be involved in regulating inflammatory and immune-associated pathways.
