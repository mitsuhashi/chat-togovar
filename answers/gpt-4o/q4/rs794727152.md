Certainly! rs794727152 is a specific reference SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) ID in the dbSNP database, which is commonly used in genomics to catalog genetic variations. This particular SNP is notable because it is associated with a pathogenic variant in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene, specifically the **c.1521_1523delCTT** mutation. This mutation results in the deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 of the CFTR protein, commonly referred to as **p.Phe508del** or **ﾎ認508**.

**Key details about rs794727152:**
1. **Clinical significance**: The ﾎ認508 variant is the most common mutation linked to cystic fibrosis (CF), a recessive genetic disorder that severely affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems due to the production of thick, sticky mucus.
2. **Pathogenicity**: ﾎ認508 is classified as a pathogenic mutation because it disrupts the proper folding and function of the CFTR protein, which functions as a chloride ion channel in epithelial cells.
3. **Genomic location**: The mutation occurs in the **CFTR gene**, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position 7q31.2.
4. **Inheritance**: As cystic fibrosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, individuals with two copies of this variant (homozygous for ﾎ認508) typically have severe CF, while heterozygous carriers generally do not present symptoms but can pass on the mutation to offspring.

This variant has been extensively studied and is a major focus of research on CF therapies, including treatments that target defective CFTR folding and function, such as small-molecule correctors and potentiators (e.g., ivacaftor and lumacaftor).
