The variant **rs794726784** is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the *CFTR* gene, which is associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) and other related conditions. It is more commonly referred to as the **c.1521_1523delCTT** variant or the **p.Phe508del** mutation (also called **F508del**). This mutation is the most common pathogenic variant in the *CFTR* gene and is a deletion of three nucleotides, resulting in the loss of the phenylalanine residue (F) at position 508 of the resulting CFTR protein.

### Key Points:
1. **Gene:** *CFTR* (*Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator*).
2. **Genomic Location:** This mutation is found on chromosome 7 at 7q31.2.
3. **Variant Type:** A 3-base pair deletion (in-frame deletion).
4. **Protein Effect:** Causes the deletion of phenylalanine (F) at position 508 (p.Phe508del) in the CFTR protein.
5. **Clinical Significance:** 
   - It is the most frequent mutation causing cystic fibrosis, present in approximately 70% of CF patients worldwide.
   - Homozygosity for this variant typically results in the classical, severe form of CF.
6. **Functional Impact:** The p.Phe508del mutation disrupts the folding and trafficking of the CFTR protein, causing it to be degraded prematurely and preventing it from reaching the cell membrane. This leads to defective chloride ion transport, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis, including thick mucus secretions, lung infections, and pancreatic dysfunction.

### Clinical Testing:
This variant is routinely screened for in genetic testing panels for cystic fibrosis diagnosis, carrier testing, and newborn screening. Therapies like CFTR modulators (e.g., ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor) have been developed to partially compensate for the defective protein in individuals with the p.Phe508del mutation. These treatments are tailored to patients based on their mutation profile.
