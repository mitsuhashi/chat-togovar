Certainly! The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs121913279** refers to a specific variant in the human genome associated with a pathogenic mutation of the **BRCA2** gene. This gene is crucial for DNA repair through homologous recombination, and pathogenic variants within BRCA2 are strongly linked to an increased risk of various cancers, particularly breast and ovarian cancers. This specific SNP is well-documented in clinical genetic databases, such as ClinVar, where it is classified as pathogenic.

Here are some key details about **rs121913279**:

1. **Gene**: It is located in the **BRCA2** gene, which is important for maintaining genome stability.
   
2. **Variant**: This variant is a single nucleotide substitution resulting in a nonsense mutation (a premature stop codon). The specific change is often denoted as **c.6174delT** (a deletion of a thymine at position 6174 in the coding sequence), leading to **p.Lys2062Ter** (K2062X), where lysine at position 2062 is replaced by a stop codon. This creates a truncated protein that is nonfunctional.

3. **Pathogenicity**: The mutation is classified as **pathogenic** and is strongly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). It is included in risk assessment panels for predicting cancer predisposition.

4. **Distribution**: The variant has been observed more frequently in certain populations, including individuals of **Ashkenazi Jewish** descent, where it is a well-known founder mutation.

5. **Clinical Relevance**: Testing for this variant is important in the context of genetic counseling, particularly for individuals with a family history of BRCA2-related cancers. Identification of this mutation can guide treatment options and preventive interventions.
