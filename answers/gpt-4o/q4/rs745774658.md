The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs745774658** is a specific variant in the human genome. Based on the publicly available data, this SNP involves a change in the **APOB (Apolipoprotein B)** gene, which plays a critical role in lipid metabolism as it encodes a key protein involved in the assembly and transport of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), also known as "bad cholesterol." 

Here is a summary of what is known about **rs745774658**:

1. **Sequence Change**: The rs745774658 variant is recorded as causing a substitution in the APOB gene. Specifically, it results in a missense mutation, changing one amino acid in the protein sequence. The most commonly reported nucleotide change is **c.11272G>A**, which leads to the amino acid substitution **p.Asp3758Asn** (Aspartic acid to Asparagine at position 3758).

2. **Clinical Significance**: This variant has been studied in connection with **Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)**, a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. The alteration in the APOB gene may reduce the protein's ability to interact with the LDL receptor, leading to an increase in circulating LDL cholesterol.

3. **Frequency and Populations**: According to population databases (such as gnomAD), rs745774658 is very rare, and its allele frequency is low or absent in many populations.

4. **Clinical Annotations**: It is classified as a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in some clinical assessments due to its association with FH. However, the precise impact may depend on individual genetic and environmental factors.

5. **Evidence and Studies**: Functional studies and clinical case analyses (including lipid profiles of affected individuals) support the hypothesis that this variant disrupts normal APOB protein function.
