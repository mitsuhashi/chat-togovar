rs113488022 is a **single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)**, which refers to a specific DNA sequence variation that occurs at a single position in the genome. Based on currently available data:

- rs113488022 is located in the *OR4F16* gene, which encodes **olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily F member 16**, involved in the detection of odorants in the olfactory system.
- The SNP represents a substitution of **guanine (G) with thymine (T)** at a particular position in the DNA sequence.
- **Chromosome location**: It is mapped to chromosome **19** (GRCh38 human genome assembly).
- The observed allele frequencies may vary across populations, but the T allele is typically rare in the global population. The exact frequency depends on the genomic dataset or population studied (e.g., 1000 Genomes, gnomAD).
- Functional impact predictions: While there is limited evidence directly linking rs113488022 to a phenotypic trait, it is most likely a **missense variant** if associated with coding regions, potentially altering amino acid coding in the *OR4F16* protein. However, predictions about functionality (e.g., damaging or benign) require computational analysis tools such as SIFT or PolyPhen.

Do note that specific traits or implications of this SNP are not well characterized in the literature as of now.
