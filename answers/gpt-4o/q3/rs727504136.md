The rs727504136 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with a known pathogenic mutation in the **CFTR** gene. Specifically, rs727504136 refers to the F508del (phenylalanine deletion at position 508) mutation, which is the most common mutation causing **cystic fibrosis (CF)**.

### Molecular-level Effects:
- **Type of Mutation**: The mutation is a 3-base pair deletion in the CFTR gene, leading to the loss of a phenylalanine at codon 508 within the CFTR protein.
- **Protein Structure**: The deletion occurs in the **nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1)** of the CFTR protein, disrupting proper protein folding and stability. This prevents the CFTR chloride channel from reaching the cell membrane.
- **Protein Function**: As a result of improper folding, the CFTR protein is targeted for degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. This impairs chloride and water transport across epithelial cell membranes, leading to the thick mucus associated with cystic fibrosis.

### Phenotypic Effects:
- Individuals who are homozygous for the F508del mutation (rs727504136) generally have **classic cystic fibrosis** characterized by:
  - Chronic respiratory infections and lung damage.
  - Pancreatic insufficiency and impaired digestion.
  - Elevated sweat chloride levels (used diagnostically).
- Heterozygous carriers of the mutation typically do not exhibit symptoms but may have a slightly increased susceptibility to certain conditions compared to non-carriers.

### Cellular-level Effects:
1. **Loss of CFTR Function**:
   - CFTR normally functions as a chloride channel, critical for maintaining ion and fluid balance in epithelial tissues. The F508del mutation leads to little or no functional CFTR on the cell surface.
2. **Impact on Ion Transport**:
   - Without functional CFTR, epithelial cells cannot regulate chloride transport, leading to dehydration of mucosal surfaces and the abnormal buildup of mucus.

### Therapeutic Implications:
- The F508del mutation is a target for several CF therapies:
  - **Correctors**: Small molecules like **lumacaftor** (in Trikafta, Orkambi) that improve CFTR protein folding and trafficking to the cell membrane.
  - **Potentiators**: Molecules like **ivacaftor** that enhance the activity of CFTR channels that reach the cell surface, even if their function is slightly impaired.

In summary, rs727504136 (F508del) leads to a loss of function in the CFTR protein due to defective folding, processing, and trafficking, which causes the systemic symptoms of cystic fibrosis in homozygotes.
