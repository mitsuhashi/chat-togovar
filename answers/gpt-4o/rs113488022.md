The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs113488022 is located in the **EPAS1** gene, which encodes the **hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF-2α)**. EPAS1 plays a key role in the cellular response to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) and mediates the expression of genes involved in oxygen homeostasis.

The clinical phenotype associated with rs113488022 is influenced by its effect on the function or regulation of EPAS1 and, subsequently, the hypoxic response. This SNP has been studied particularly in the context of its effects on oxygen regulation and adaptation to environmental hypoxia.

### Key Influences on Clinical Phenotypes:

1. **High-Altitude Adaptation**:
   - rs113488022 and other variants in EPAS1 are strongly associated with high-altitude adaptation, especially in Tibetan and other high-altitude populations. These populations exhibit an improved ability to survive and reproduce in hypoxic conditions.
   - The SNP alters EPAS1 expression or function in a way that reduces excessive red blood cell production (hemoglobin levels), preventing complications like chronic mountain sickness or polycythemia at high altitudes.

2. **Disorders Related to Oxygen Sensing**:
   - Mutations or polymorphisms in EPAS1, including rs113488022, can influence clinical phenotypes in diseases related to oxygen sensing, such as certain forms of familial erythrocytosis. Dysregulation of HIF-2α activity due to genetic alterations can lead to overproduction of red blood cells.
   - Rare gain-of-function mutations in EPAS1 have been linked to erythrocytosis and even tumor development (e.g., pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas) due to aberrant oxygen signaling pathways.

3. **Potential Metabolic Impacts**:
   - EPAS1 polymorphisms have been explored for their roles in metabolic responses to hypoxia. Variants like rs113488022 may influence glucose metabolism, energy balance, and lipid profiles due to altered hypoxic signaling pathways, potentially contributing to differences in susceptibility to metabolic disorders.

4. **Cancer Pathophysiology**:
   - Altered function of EPAS1 due to genetic variants such as rs113488022 can impact angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis in hypoxic environments. HIF-2α plays a role in the regulation of genes involved in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and other pathways critical for tumor progression.

In summary, the location and effect of rs113488022 within the EPAS1 gene influence hypoxic signaling pathways, contributing to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes, from high-altitude physiological adaptation to pathological conditions like erythrocytosis, metabolic disorders, and cancer. Detailed functional studies are often required to understand the specific molecular and clinical effects of this polymorphism.
