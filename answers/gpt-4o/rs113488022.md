The variant **rs113488022** is located in the **GJB2 gene**, which encodes the connexin 26 protein, a component of gap junctions important for cellular communication. Pathogenic variations in the GJB2 gene are strongly associated with hearing loss, both autosomal recessive (non-syndromic hearing loss, DFNB1) and autosomal dominant (rare cases of syndromic or non-syndromic hearing loss, DFNA3).

### Influence of rs113488022 on the Clinical Phenotype:
- **Nature of the Variant**: The rs113488022 variant represents a missense mutation in the GJB2 gene. Specifically, it results in an amino acid substitution, **p.V37I (Valine substituted by Isoleucine at position 37)**.
  
- **Clinical Impact**:
  - **Mild-to-Moderate Hearing Loss**: The p.V37I mutation is commonly associated with mild-to-moderate **sensorineural hearing loss**, particularly when present in the homozygous state or when combined with another pathogenic GJB2 variant (compound heterozygosity). The phenotype can vary in severity based on additional genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors.
  - **Carrier State (Heterozygosity)**: Individuals heterozygous for rs113488022 typically do not display severe hearing phenotypes. However, they might exhibit a predisposition to late-onset or mild hearing impairment.
  - **Incomplete Penetrance**: The expression of hearing loss associated with p.V37I may be incompletely penetrant, meaning not all individuals carrying the variant express the clinical phenotype, complicating its interpretation.

- **Population-Specific Frequency**: 
  - p.V37I is more frequently observed in East Asian populations, where it has been reported as one of the more common GJB2 variants associated with hearing loss.
  - Its relatively high allele frequency in some populations suggests that it could act as a low-penetrance risk allele, influencing hearing loss only under specific circumstances (e.g., when combined with other genetic or environmental factors).

- **Syndromic vs. Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss**: Generally, rs113488022 is a cause of **non-syndromic hearing loss**, meaning it does not typically present with other systemic symptoms. However, rare exceptions have been noted in the literature.

### Clinical Testing and Interpretation:
- Genetic testing for GJB2 variants, including rs113488022, is commonly conducted to diagnose congenital or early-onset hearing loss.
- Identifying rs113488022 can inform genetic counseling, particularly in determining the risk of hearing loss in offspring or evaluating potential compound heterozygosity with more severe GJB2 mutations.

### Summary:
The rs113488022 variant (p.V37I) in GJB2 has a variable influence on clinical phenotype, most often linked to mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss when homozygous or in compound heterozygosity. Its impact is influenced by genetic background, environmental factors, and possibly modifier genes. This makes careful clinical and genetic analysis essential for prognosis and counseling in affected families.
