The variant known as **rs121918719** is associated with **Marfan syndrome**, a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the **FBN1** gene, which encodes fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is an **autosomal dominant** condition, meaning that inheriting one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Therefore, the rs121918719 variant is considered **dominant**.

Marfan syndrome is characterized by features affecting the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems, and the disorder can vary in severity. If you are analyzing a patient's genetic data and considering this variant, it is essential to assess their clinical presentation and family history, as genetic counseling may be recommended.
