rs796053166 is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human genome. Determining whether this variant functions in a dominant, recessive, or other mode of inheritance depends on the gene it is located in, how it affects that gene's function, and how it interacts with other alleles.

To assess whether rs796053166 is dominant or recessive, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Gene and Variant Function**: Does the variant cause a loss-of-function, gain-of-function, or other type of change? Critical genes tied to essential biological functions may behave differently depending on the nature of the variant.

2. **Clinical Evidence**: Is this SNP associated with any known disease or trait? If so, studies that characterize the inheritance patterns in families or individuals may provide insight.

3. **Population Frequency and Zygosity**: Is this variant found in heterozygous or homozygous states in healthy individuals? Variants with severe dominant effects are less likely to be found in the general population.

For rs796053166, hereâ€™s what we know:

- **dbSNP Information**: rs796053166 is a rare variant located in the *CYP3A5* gene, which codes for one of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
- **Variant Details**: This variant is also known as *CYP3A5* p.Thr398Asn (NM_000777.5: c.1193C>A), a missense mutation predicted to alter the enzyme's function.
- **Recessive or Dominant Effect**: Existing studies have not definitively characterized this variant as dominant or recessive. However, many *CYP3A5* polymorphisms influence drug metabolism in an additive or codominant manner, where both alleles contribute to the enzymatic activity level rather than following strict dominant/recessive inheritance.

In practice, whether rs796053166 behaves as dominant or recessive would depend on the biological context and the trait being measured (e.g., drug response or disease susceptibility). If you are asking in relation to a specific trait or condition, further research into population studies, experimental assays, and inheritance data would be needed to clarify its mode of inheritance.
