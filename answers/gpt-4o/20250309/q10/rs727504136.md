The classification of a variant like **rs727504136** as dominant or recessive depends on a variety of factors, including:

1. **The gene it is in** - Different genes have different modes of inheritance.
2. **The functional impact of the variant** - Is the variant pathogenic, benign, or of uncertain significance?
3. **The trait or condition associated with the variant** - Some conditions may act dominantly in some contexts and recessively in others.
4. **Zygosity** - Whether the variant is present in one copy (heterozygous) or both copies (homozygous) in the individual can affect its clinical manifestation.

### Key Details About rs727504136:
- **rs727504136** corresponds to a well-known variant in the *CFTR* gene, specifically **c.1521_1523delCTT** or **p.Phe508del (F508del)**.
- This variant is strongly associated with **cystic fibrosis (CF)**, a recessive condition.

### Inheritance Mode of rs727504136:
- The **p.Phe508del (F508del)** mutation is **recessive**.  
    - Individuals **homozygous** for this variant (carrying two copies) are typically affected by cystic fibrosis.
    - Individuals who are **heterozygous** (carrying one copy) are usually asymptomatic carriers.

In summary, rs727504136 (p.Phe508del in CFTR) is classified as a **recessive** variant with regard to its role in cystic fibrosis inheritance.
