To determine whether **rs571414497** is associated with a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern, we need to review specific contextual information for this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Here are the key steps to investigate further:

### 1. **Variant Population Frequency**
   - Check the frequency of the variant in databases like  **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)** or **dbSNP**. If it is exceedingly rare, it might indicate a potential disease association, but whether it is dominant or recessive would depend on further studies.

### 2. **Clinical Significance**
   - Search databases like **ClinVar** to see if there are known clinical associations for rs571414497. Look for reports that indicate whether it is associated with a specific phenotype and if an inheritance mode (e.g., dominant or recessive) has been established.

### 3. **Functional Impact**
   - Review any annotations from tools like **SIFT**, **PolyPhen**, or **REVEL**, which predict the impact of the variant on protein function. Variants with a likely loss-of-function effect might behave in recessive patterns unless haploinsufficiency (in dominant cases) is established for the gene.

### 4. **Gene Context**
   - Look up the gene in which **rs571414497** resides. Determine whether diseases associated with this gene are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern. For instance:
     - If the gene is associated primarily with loss-of-function variants in recessive disorders, then rs571414497 might be recessive.
     - If the gene is associated with gain-of-function variants in dominant disorders, rs571414497 might be dominant.

### 5. **Literature Search**
   - Check scientific literature for any reports of rs571414497 associated with phenotypes. Tools like **PubMed** or specialty variant curation sites might have more detail.

### Example Tools and Resources:
   - **dbSNP:** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)
   - **ClinVar:** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)
   - **gnomAD:** [https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)

### Summary:
Without more specific details on rs571414497, it is difficult to say whether the variant exhibits a dominant or recessive pattern. A detailed review of population frequency, gene function, and clinical evidence should clarify its inheritance model. Let me know if you'd like me to guide you through these database searches!
