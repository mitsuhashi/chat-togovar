The pathogenicity and inheritance pattern (dominant vs. recessive) of a specific genetic variant such as **rs796052984** cannot be determined solely based on the rsID. To understand whether this variant acts in a dominant or recessive manner, we need more information, including:

1. **Gene Context**: What gene is this variant located in? The inheritance mode often depends on the gene and its normal biological function.

2. **Variant Type**: Is it a missense, nonsense, frameshift, or regulatory variant? The type of variant can influence its effect on the gene product.

3. **Clinical Significance**: Has this variant been associated with a specific disease or trait in the scientific literature or annotated in databases like ClinVar, dbSNP, or gnomAD as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, or of uncertain significance?

4. **Zygosity**: How it manifests (as dominant or recessive) depends on whether the variant-causing disease appears when the individual carries one copy of the variant (heterozygous case, dominant effect) or two copies (homozygous or compound heterozygous case, recessive effect).

5. **Allele Frequency**: Variants with very low allele frequencies are more likely to be associated with recessive diseases, although exceptions exist.

To research **rs796052984**:

- The variant **rs796052984** is in the **PRKN (parkin)** gene, according to publicly available databases like dbSNP and ClinVar.
- The PRKN gene is associated with **autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson's disease** (AR-JP). Variants in PRKN are typically associated with a **recessive** mode of inheritance. 
- This specific SNV (single nucleotide variant) is likely linked to Parkinsonâ€™s disease when *both alleles* of the gene are affected (homozygous or compound heterozygous state).

If this variant has been identified in a clinical or research setting, I recommend reviewing its annotation in **ClinVar**, **gnoMAD**, or consulting the primary literature for detailed functional studies of its impact. Let me know if you'd like specific guidance with these databases!
