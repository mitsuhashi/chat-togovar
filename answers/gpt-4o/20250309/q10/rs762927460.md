To determine whether the rs762927460 variant is dominant or recessive, we need more context—specifically, information about the mode of inheritance associated with this variant in a disease or trait. This depends on several factors:

1. **Phenotype Association**: Is rs762927460 associated with a specific disease or trait? If so, what is known about the genetic inheritance pattern of that condition?

2. **Variant Context**: What gene is rs762927460 in, and is it predicted to cause a functional change (e.g., missense, nonsense, frameshift, or regulatory effect)? Not all variants affect a gene’s function, and sometimes their functional impact is speculative.

3. **Population Data**: How frequent is rs762927460 in the general population? Rare variants are more likely to be associated with recessive conditions if they need two copies to manifest a phenotype.

4. **Studies and Experimental Evidence**: Are there functional studies, clinical reports, or inheritance analyses (e.g., family studies) that have explored this variant? Such studies might reveal whether it is associated with dominant or recessive inheritance.

### Steps You Can Take:
- **Access Databases**: Look up rs762927460 in accessible genomic databases such as:
  - [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/): For clinical significance and inheritance data.
  - [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/): To see population frequency, which can hint at its possible impact.
  - [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/): For general variant information.
  
- **Literature Review**: Search for studies that mention rs762927460 in relation to a phenotype.

- **Functional Annotation**: Look for variant-effect predictors in tools like SIFT, PolyPhen-2, or CADD to understand its potential impact on the protein, if the variant is in a coding region.

If you can provide additional background—such as clinical symptoms, phenotype associations, the gene involved, or information from a genetic test report—I can assist you more specifically!
