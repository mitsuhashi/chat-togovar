The classification of a variant such as **rs796053216** (or any other genomic variant) as *dominant* or *recessive* depends on multiple factors:

1. **The gene it affects**: Different genes can have dominant or recessive effects depending on how they contribute to a phenotype or disease.
2. **The functional effect of the variant**: Is it a loss-of-function (LoF), gain-of-function (GoF), missense, or regulatory variant? These effects can influence how it behaves in an inheritance context.
3. **The associated phenotype**: If the variant is linked to a disease or trait, the inheritance pattern of that phenotype (e.g., Mendelian dominant or recessive) is crucial to understanding its classification.
4. **Published research**: The classification of specific variants often depends on peer-reviewed studies tying them to phenotypes or diseases and analyzing them in families or populations.

### Steps to determine if rs796053216 is dominant or recessive:
1. Look at the genomic location of **rs796053216** to identify which gene it affects.
2. Search databases like **ClinVar**, **gnomAD**, and **dbSNP** for functional annotations, allele frequencies, and clinical significance (e.g., pathogenic, benign, etc.).
3. Investigate published studies in resources such as **PubMed**.
4. Check databases like **OMIM** (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) for the associated inheritance pattern of the gene/disease involved.

### Example Check for rs796053216:
- **dbSNP**: Provides basic variant information, including location, frequency, and reported studies.
- **ClinVar**: Ascertains clinical significance and inheritance patterns if the variant has been studied.
- **gnomAD**: Provides population allele frequencies, which can help infer whether the variant might be rare or common.
- **Ensembl/NCBI**: Allows you to look at gene function and conservation.
