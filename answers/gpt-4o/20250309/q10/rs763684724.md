The variant **rs763684724** is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) listed in the dbSNP database, but determining whether a specific variant is **dominant** or **recessive** depends on its **functional impact** and the **phenotype or trait** it is associated with. This information cannot be deduced solely from the rsID itself without additional supporting data.

Here are the steps to determine whether rs763684724 exhibits dominant or recessive inheritance:

### 1. **Function of the Variant**:
   - Look up the **gene** where rs763684724 is located. Does the gene play a role in a recessive or dominant condition?
   - Check if the variant is in a coding region, regulatory region, splicing site, etc., and whether it introduces a loss-of-function (LoF) or gain-of-function effect. 

### 2. **Pathogenicity Data**:
   - Search for the variant in a database like **ClinVar**, which provides insight into whether rs763684724 is associated with any diseases or conditions, and how it behaves (dominant, recessive, or uncertain).
   - Other databases such as **gnomAD**, **Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)**, or **OMIM** could provide pathogenicity and population frequency data.

### 3. **Phenotype and Inheritance Patterns**:
   - If the phenotype caused by the variant is known, analyze how the trait is inherited within families. For example:
     - A **dominant variant** will typically cause a trait or disease if one copy of the allele is present.
     - A **recessive variant** requires two copies (homozygosity) to manifest the trait or disease.

### 4. **Population Frequency**:
   - If the variant is very rare and found primarily in individuals with a specific disease or phenotype, it increases the likelihood that it contributes to the condition. However, its mode of inheritance still needs to be confirmed.

### Example Scenarios:
   - **Dominant Variant**: If rs763684724 causes a protein to gain a new function or interfere with the function of its partner proteins, it may exhibit a **dominant inheritance pattern**.
   - **Recessive Variant**: If rs763684724 results in complete loss of gene function but the trait only manifests when both copies of the gene (homozygous recessive) are disrupted, it would be a **recessive variant**.

### Recommendation:
To definitively classify rs763684724, gather additional evidence:
- Query ClinVar or other variant databases for clinical interpretations.
- Review the literature for studies of the variant.
- Perform functional assays or population genetics studies, if necessary.
