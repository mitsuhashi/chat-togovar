The classification of a specific genetic variant, such as **rs12037987**, as dominant or recessive depends not on the variant itself per se but on its association with a particular phenotype or disease and the inheritance pattern of that trait. To determine whether **rs12037987** follows a dominant, recessive, or some other form of inheritance, we need information about:

1. **The gene where rs12037987 is located**: This SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) resides in a specific gene or regulatory region, and its effects will depend on its role in the gene's function.

2. **The phenotype or trait linked to rs12037987**: Studies or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) connecting this variant to a particular trait or condition are necessary to interpret whether it has a dominant or recessive effect.

3. **Genotype-phenotype relationship**: If carriers of one copy of the variant (heterozygous state) express the associated phenotype, it may be considered **dominant**. If two copies of the variant (homozygous state) are needed to express the phenotype, it would be **recessive**.

### Steps to Answer Your Question:
1. Identify the gene or region associated with **rs12037987**.
2. Look in scientific literature (e.g., GWAS Catalog or PubMed) for studies linking it to a phenotype.
3. Review the inheritance pattern of the associated phenotype.
