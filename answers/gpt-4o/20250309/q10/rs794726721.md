The rs794726721 is a specific variant identifier in the dbSNP database, and whether it is classified as dominant or recessive depends on the context of the associated genetic condition and how the variant affects the phenotype. Determining whether rs794726721 exhibits a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern requires information about:

1. **The associated gene**: Which gene the variant is located in.
2. **The nature of the variant**: If it is a missense, nonsense, frameshift, or regulatory variant, and how it affects gene function.
3. **Clinical evidence**: Studies describing how carriers of one or two copies of the variant are affected.
4. **The condition**: Some genetic conditions display variable inheritance patterns (e.g., autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked).

As of the time of this response, rs794726721 is a pathogenic variant in the **MEFV** gene and is associated with **Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)**, which is an **autosomal recessive** disorder. This means that two copies of the variant (one inherited from each parent) are generally required to cause the disease. Individuals with one copy of the variant (heterozygotes) are usually asymptomatic carriers, though they may sometimes exhibit milder symptoms in certain cases.

To confirm the status of rs794726721 in specific contexts or populations, consult clinical studies, databases like ClinVar, or a genetic counselor.
