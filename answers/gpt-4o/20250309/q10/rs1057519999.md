The designation **rs1057519999** refers to a specific variant identifier in the dbSNP database, managed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). However, whether a variant is **dominant**, **recessive**, or has some other pattern of inheritance depends on:

1. **Functional Impact of the Variant**: Does it occur in a protein-coding region, regulatory region, or non-coding region? How does it affect the associated gene's function?
   
2. **Associated Gene**: The gene where the variant is located and its role in a human disease or trait.

3. **Population Studies**: Observational studies in affected individuals and their families determine inheritance patterns.

Unfortunately, determining whether rs1057519999 is dominant or recessive requires additional details like the gene it affects, its functional annotation, and clinical significance, if known. If you have access to the dbSNP page, annotation from databases like ClinVar, or any publication related to this variant, it can guide us on its inheritance pattern.

Would you like me to guide you on how to look up rs1057519999 in public genomic databases like **dbSNP** or suggest next steps?
