To determine whether rs876660744 is a dominant or recessive variant, we need more context, such as the genetic condition it is associated with, the inheritance pattern, and functional evidence. However, we can provide some general guidance on this type of question:

1. **Understanding rs876660744**: This is an *rsID* (Reference SNP cluster ID) used to identify a specific genetic variant in the human genome. You can look up this variant in public genomic databases such as:
   - **dbSNP** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
   - **ClinVar** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) for clinical significance.
   - **gnomAD** (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) to assess frequency in the population.

2. **Inheritance pattern**: Whether a variant is dominant or recessive depends on how it affects gene function and the phenotype:
   - **Dominant variant**: A single copy of the variant (heterozygous state) is enough to manifest the trait or condition.
   - **Recessive variant**: Two copies of the variant (homozygous state) are required to manifest the trait or condition.

3. **Next Steps**: To evaluate rs876660744 specifically:
   - Check **ClinVar** to see if itâ€™s associated with a condition and whether it has a known inheritance pattern.
   - Review studies in **PubMed** to see if research on this specific SNP provides details about its pathogenicity and dominance/recessivity.
   - Analyze the functional consequences (e.g., protein-coding effect, regulatory effect) and allele frequency in the population, which may hint at its phenotypic impact.

In summary, the dominance or recessiveness of rs876660744 would require more information about the trait or disease it influences, as well as functional evidence. Let me know if you'd like assistance looking up this variant in a specific database!
