As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, rs1057519999 is a reference single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in genomic databases like dbSNP. However, there appears to be no well-documented information specifically about rs1057519999 and its effects on the structure and function of genes. If this SNP were significant, its details (e.g., the exact nucleotide change, associated gene, and phenotypic impact) would likely be described in genomics databases or scientific literature.

### General Guidelines on How SNPs Can Affect Genes:
1. **Impact on Coding Regions (Exons)**:
   - **Missense Mutation**: Changes one amino acid in a protein, potentially altering its structure and function.
   - **Nonsense Mutation**: Introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein, which may be nonfunctional.
   - **Silent Mutation**: Does not change the amino acid but can affect mRNA stability or splicing in rare cases.

2. **Impact on Non-Coding Regions**:
   - **Promoter/Enhancer Regions**: SNPs here can impact the binding of transcription factors, altering gene expression levels.
   - **Intron Regions**: May affect splicing if they disrupt splice sites or create new ones, potentially resulting in aberrant mRNA.
   - **UTRs (Untranslated Regions)**: Variants in 5' or 3' UTRs can influence mRNA stability, translation efficiency, or microRNA binding.

3. **Impact Depending on Context**:
   - **Gain or Loss of Function**: A functional SNP can increase or decrease the activity of a gene's associated protein.
   - **Risk of Disease**: Some SNPs are associated with increased or decreased risk of certain diseases due to their effects on gene function or regulation.

### How to Investigate rs1057519999:
- **Use Genomics Databases**:
  - Search in databases like **dbSNP (NCBI)**, **Ensembl**, or **UCSC Genome Browser** for information on its genomic position, associated gene, and potential functional annotations.
- **Literature Review**:
  - Look for publications in repositories like **PubMed** that might mention studies involving rs1057519999.
- **Functional Annotation Tools**:
  - Use tools like **SIFT**, **PolyPhen**, or **RegulomeDB** to predict the effect of the SNP on protein function or gene regulation.

If you can provide more specific context about this SNP (e.g., the gene it resides in, associated diseases, or functional study results), I'd be happy to refine the answer!
