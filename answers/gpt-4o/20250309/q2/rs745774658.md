The rs745774658 is a reference SNP ID used to catalog a specific genetic variant within the human genome. To understand its effect on the structure and function of genes, we need information specific to the variant, such as its location (e.g., coding vs. noncoding region), the type of mutation (e.g., missense, nonsense, insertion, deletion, etc.), and its functional consequences (e.g., synonymous, frameshift, regulatory impact).

### Steps to Analyze rs745774658:
1. **Variant Details**: 
   - The rsID is a reference label for the specific location of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or a small insertion/deletion. For rs745774658, the information about the change (e.g., the specific nucleotide substitution or deletion) and its genomic position must be retrieved from a database like dbSNP or Ensemble Genome Browser.

2. **Effects on Genes**:
   - If rs745774658 is in a **coding region**, it could lead to:
     - A **synonymous mutation**: No change in the amino acid sequence, so usually no functional impact.
     - A **missense mutation**: Change in the amino acid sequence, potentially altering protein structure and function.
     - A **nonsense mutation**: Introduction of a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated, likely nonfunctional protein.
     - A **frameshift mutation**: Shifts the reading frame and changes downstream amino acids, usually leading to a nonfunctional protein.
   - If rs745774658 is in a **noncoding region**, it could:
     - Affect regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers, or silencers) and influence gene expression levels.
     - Impact splicing by altering splice sites (leading to exon skipping or intron inclusion).
     - Influence the binding of transcription factors or RNA-binding proteins, affecting gene regulation.

3. **Functional Consequences**:
   - Variants like rs745774658 may be benign, deleterious, or damaging, depending on the impact on protein function and dynamics. Prediction tools such as PolyPhen, SIFT, or CADD can help assess the potential impact.

4. **Clinical Relevance**:
   - If rs745774658 is associated with a disease or phenotype, this can be explored through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or by consulting curated clinical variant databases like ClinVar.

5. **Experimental Validation**:
   - Investigating the functional effects of rs745774658 would generally require laboratory techniques like gene expression profiling, protein structure analysis, or functional assays.

To provide a more specific answer about *how rs745774658 impacts the structure and function of genes*, its individual characteristics would need to be consulted from databases like NCBI’s dbSNP, Ensembl, or from relevant literature. Let me know if you’d like help navigating these resources!
