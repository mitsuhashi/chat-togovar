The rs1170153450 allele is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and its effect on gene structure and function depends on a variety of factors including its location in the genome (coding region, regulatory region, intron, etc.) and the nature of the nucleotide change. Unfortunately, without more context or functional studies, it is difficult to infer precisely what rs1170153450 does. However, here is an outline of how specific genetic variants can generally impact genes:

1. **Location in the Genome**:
   - **Coding Region (Exonic)**: If rs1170153450 occurs in a coding region, it could lead to:
     - **Synonymous Mutation**: No change in the amino acid sequence but could affect mRNA stability or translation efficiency.
     - **Nonsynonymous Mutation**: Change in the amino acid sequence, potentially altering the protein's structure and function.
     - **Nonsense Mutation**: Creation of a stop codon, leading to truncated, likely nonfunctional proteins.

   - **Intronic Region**: If rs1170153450 is located in an intron, it could affect gene splicing, possibly creating or disrupting splice sites, leading to alternative splicing or exon skipping.

   - **Regulatory Region** (e.g., promoters, enhancers): If located in a regulatory region, the allele could influence gene expression by altering transcription factor binding or epigenetic marks.

   - **Noncoding RNA Region**: If rs1170153450 affects a noncoding RNA, it could impact the regulatory activities of small RNAs (like miRNAs) or long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that impact gene expression or mRNA stability.

2. **Functional Consequences**:
   - **Protein Function**: A nonsynonymous mutation might change protein folding, stability, or active site configuration, impacting its function.
   - **Gene Expression**: Alterations in regulatory elements due to this SNP might increase or decrease the transcription of the associated gene.
   - **Disease Association**: The allele could be associated with certain phenotypes or diseases, depending on its functional consequences.

3. **Experimental Evidence**:
   - Predicting the precise outcome of rs1170153450 requires experimental validation or computational annotations from resources like dbSNP, ClinVar, or literature addressing the specific SNP.

To fully understand how rs1170153450 affects the structure and function of genes, detailed studies including functional assays, expression data, or population-level analyses will be needed. If associated with a particular study or disease model, additional exploration in the literature or databases would provide more insight. Can you provide more context about this allele?
