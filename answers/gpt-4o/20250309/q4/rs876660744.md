Rs876660744 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) cataloged in the dbSNP (Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Based on its rsID, it is a reference SNP. However, information about this specific SNP, such as its genomic location, associated gene(s), variant effect, minor allele frequency (MAF), clinical significance, or involvement in phenotypes, is not provided directly in your query.

To offer a detailed summary, access to the dbSNP database or related sources like Ensembl, the GWAS Catalog, or ClinVar would be necessary to gather data such as:

1. **Genomic position** (chromosome and base pair location).
2. **Ancestral and alternate alleles**.
3. **Functional impact** (e.g., synonymous, missense, or non-coding).
4. **Population allele frequencies**.
5. **Clinical associations** (if any).
6. **Research findings** linking it to diseases or traits.
