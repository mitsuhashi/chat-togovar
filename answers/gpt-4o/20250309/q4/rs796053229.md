Certainly! rs796053229 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the human genome. It is associated with a specific genetic variant that causes a pathogenic substitution in the **CFTR** (*Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator*) gene. This gene plays a critical role in encoding a protein involved in the regulation of salt and water transport across cell membranes.

### Key Facts about rs796053229:
- **Variant Details**: It denotes the nucleotide change **c.3454G>C**, which results in the amino acid substitution **p.Asp1152His (D1152H)** within the CFTR protein.
- **Clinical Relevance**: The D1152H variant is associated with **Cystic Fibrosis (CF)**, a common autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. However, this specific mutation is considered a **mild or variable CF mutation** because it often leads to residual CFTR function compared to other more severe mutations.
- **Pathogenicity Classification**: This SNP is generally classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, particularly when found in compound heterozygosity with other severe CFTR mutations. Its clinical impact can vary depending on modifier genes or environmental factors.
- **Population Frequency**: The allele frequency varies depending on the population but is relatively low, as CFTR-related pathogenic variants tend to be rare.

In summary, rs796053229 (D1152H in CFTR) is a clinically significant polymorphism associated with mild forms of cystic fibrosis, showing variable expressivity and disease outcomes. Genetic counseling and further molecular testing are typically recommended for families with this variant.
