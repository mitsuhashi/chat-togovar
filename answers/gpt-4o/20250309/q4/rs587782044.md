rs587782044 is the reference SNP ID (rsID) for a **single nucleotide variant (SNV)** in the human genome associated with the **BRCA2 gene**. This variant is also known as **NM_000059.4(BRCA2):c.9944C>T (p.Arg3315Ter)**. Here are the essential details about rs587782044:

1. **Variant Details**:
   - It is a substitution of a cytosine (C) with a thymine (T) at the nucleotide position 9944 in the BRCA2 gene coding sequence.
   - This results in the creation of a **premature stop codon** at position 3315 in the BRCA2 protein. The change is denoted as **p.Arg3315Ter** (Arginine at position 3315 is replaced by a termination signal).

2. **Effect on Protein**:
   - The premature stop codon leads to the production of a **truncated, non-functional BRCA2 protein** or causes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). As BRCA2 is crucial for DNA repair, this loss of function can compromise genomic stability.

3. **Clinical Significance**:
   - This variant has been classified as **pathogenic** in association with an increased risk for **hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome** (HBOC).
   - Individuals carrying this mutation have a significantly elevated lifetime risk of developing **breast**, **ovarian**, and potentially other cancers (e.g., pancreatic cancer).

4. **Population Frequency**:
   - The variant is rare and is not commonly observed in large population databases such as gnomAD.

5. **Clinical Testing**:
   - Genetic testing and counseling for rs587782044 are recommended for individuals with a family history of BRCA-related cancers.
   - Positive identification can guide personalized risk management strategies, including enhanced cancer screening and preventive measures.

In summary, rs587782044 is a pathogenic variant in BRCA2 that disrupts the gene's function and predisposes carriers to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.
