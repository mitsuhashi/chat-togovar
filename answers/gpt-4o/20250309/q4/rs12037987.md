The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs12037987** is a genetic variant located on human chromosome **8q24.21**, a well-studied genomic region associated with various traits and diseases, particularly cancers. This region is notable for being a "gene desert" (with few protein-coding genes) but contains regulatory elements affecting the expression of nearby genes, such as **MYC**, a proto-oncogene involved in cell proliferation, growth, and cancer development.

### Key Information About rs12037987:
- **Position**: It is located within a noncoding region of **8q24**, a hotspot for SNPs associated with different types of cancer, including **prostate cancer**, **breast cancer**, **colorectal cancer**, and others.
- **Trait/Disease Associations**:
  - Primarily, rs12037987 has been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as linked to prostate cancer susceptibility.
  - It is thought to be part of a network of regulatory elements that modulate gene expression (potentially influencing **MYC** activity).
- **Regulatory Role**: SNPs in this region, including rs12037987, might act as enhancers or silencers by altering the binding of transcription factors or chromatin accessibility, thereby impacting gene regulation.
  
### Clinical Implications:
- rs12037987 is mainly of interest in cancer research. Genetic testing for variants in the **8q24** region can sometimes be used to estimate an individual's risk for specific cancers, although its clinical utility is often combined with the consideration of other risk factors.
