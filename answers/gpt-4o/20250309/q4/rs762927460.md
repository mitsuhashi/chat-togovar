The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs762927460** is a genetic variant cataloged in databases such as dbSNP. Here is a summary of key information about this SNP:

1. **rsID**: The identifier for the SNP is rs762927460, which is used to distinguish this specific variant.

2. **Variant Type**: This SNP is classified as a **single nucleotide variant** (SNV). Such variants involve the change of a single nucleotide in the genome.

3. **Genomic Location**: The exact chromosomal location of rs762927460 depends on the human genome reference build (e.g., GRCh37 or GRCh38). To provide precise details, the reference assembly must be specified.

4. **Alleles**: This SNP involves a substitution of one nucleotide for another. The reference and alternate alleles are denoted in sequencing data, such as A/G, C/T, etc.

5. **Frequency**: Based on population genomic studies, rs762927460 is a **rare variant**. Its minor allele frequency (MAF) is very low or has not been detected in large population databases like gnomAD or 1000 Genomes.

6. **Clinical Significance**: Currently, there is limited or no established clinical relevance for rs762927460. Variants like this may be classified as **uncertain significance** unless proven to be pathogenic (associated with disease) or benign.

7. **Functional Effect**: The impact of rs762927460 on gene function, if any, would depend on its genomic context:
   - If located in a coding region, it might lead to a nonsynonymous (amino acid change) or synonymous (silent) mutation.
   - If in a non-coding region, it could affect regulatory elements like enhancers, promoters, or splicing sites.
   Without functional studies, its precise biological effect is typically unknown.

8. **Population-Specific Data**: Rare variants like this one may exhibit differences in frequency across populations, but detailed information for rs762927460 is not widely available.

For more detailed or specific information, consulting databases such as **dbSNP**, **ClinVar**, **gnomAD**, or scientific literature that references rs762927460 may provide additional insights, especially if new findings emerge.
