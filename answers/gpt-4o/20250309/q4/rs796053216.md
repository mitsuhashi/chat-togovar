The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs796053216** is linked to genetic research and has been studied for its effects on specific phenotypes or diseases. Here are the key details commonly known about this SNP:

1. **Genomic Location**: 
   - rs796053216 is located in the **ANKRD26** gene (Ankyrin Repeat Domain 26), which is on chromosome **10**. Specifically, the genomic position is in the region **10p12.1**.

2. **Clinical Significance**: 
   - Variants in the ANKRD26 gene, including rs796053216, have been associated with **thrombocytopenia 2 (THC2)**, a hereditary condition characterized by low platelet counts and an increased risk of developing hematological malignancies.
   - Mutations in this region often involve regulatory variants that affect the expression of ANKRD26 in megakaryocytes (platelet-producing cells).

3. **Nature of the Variant**: 
   - rs796053216 is often described as a **regulatory or non-coding variant**, generally affecting a promoter, enhancer, or untranslated region (UTR) of the gene.

4. **Functional Impact**:
   - Studies suggest that variants like rs796053216 alter transcription factor binding at the ANKRD26 promoter, leading to abnormal gene expression during hematopoiesis.
   - It has potential implications for gene regulatory mechanisms, though further functional characterization may be needed.

5. **Population Frequency**:
   - Variants like rs796053216 tend to be rare, and their clinical penetrance (extent to which they cause a trait or disease) depends on specific genetic and environmental contexts.
   - Its allele frequency across various global populations is typically studied in population genomics databases like gnomAD.

6. **Databases with Additional Information**:
   - **ClinVar**, **dbSNP**, and **gnomAD** provide extensive data on rs796053216, including its association with disease phenotypes and allele frequencies.
   - **Ensemble Genome Browser** and **UCSC Genome Browser** are additional platforms to explore its genomic details.
