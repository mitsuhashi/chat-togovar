Certainly! The single nucleotide polymorphism **rs796053166** is a genetic variant located in the **PCSK9** gene, which encodes the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). This gene plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol levels by promoting the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on liver cells. Lower LDLR levels result in higher circulating LDL cholesterol (LDL-C).

The **rs796053166** variant corresponds to the mutation **p.Arg46Leu** (R46L), where the amino acid at position 46 is changed from arginine (R) to leucine (L). This variant has been studied extensively due to its association with reduced LDL-C levels and protection against cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Key Details:
- **Location**: PCSK9 gene, chromosome 1.
- **Type of Mutation**: Missense variant (non-synonymous).
- **Effect**: The R46L variant results in a loss-of-function (LoF) of the PCSK9 protein, leading to enhanced recycling of LDL receptors and more significant LDL-C clearance from the bloodstream.
- **Phenotypic Impact**: Carriers of this variant typically exhibit:
  - Lower levels of LDL-C.
  - Reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
- **Population Frequency**: This variant is most commonly observed in populations of European descent, though it is relatively rare overall.

### Clinical Significance:
The **p.Arg46Leu** (rs796053166) variant is considered protective against hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It has garnered significant attention in the development of PCSK9 inhibitors as therapeutic agents for managing high cholesterol and preventing heart diseases.
