The variant **rs121913529** is a well-documented single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the *BRCA2* gene. It is classified as **pathogenic** and is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). Specifically, this variant corresponds to the **c.5946delT** mutation (also referred to as **6174delT** in older nomenclatures), which results in a frameshift and the creation of a premature stop codon. This leads to a truncated and nonfunctional *BRCA2* protein, impairing the gene's critical role in DNA repair via homologous recombination.

### Key Points:
1. **Gene Involved**: *BRCA2* (Breast Cancer 2, early onset).
2. **Variant Description**: c.5946delT (HGVS nomenclature), also known as 6174delT.
3. **Consequence**: Frameshift mutation causing a premature stop codon and loss of protein function.
4. **Pathogenicity**: Classified as pathogenic; strongly linked to HBOC.
5. **Population Distribution**: Most commonly observed in individuals of **Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry**, where it represents a founder mutation with a carrier frequency of approximately 0.5â€“1.5% in this population.
6. **Clinical Implications**: Carriers of this variant have a significantly increased risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers (e.g., pancreatic cancer). The risk varies based on family history and other genetic/environmental factors.
