The SNP **rs704341** is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the *LYPLAL1* gene on chromosome 1. This gene encodes lysophospholipase-like 1, which has been implicated in lipid metabolism, although its exact biological function is not fully understood. Variants in this gene, including rs704341, have been studied in relation to metabolic traits.

### Key points about rs704341:
1. **Genomic Location**: 
   - Found on chromosome 1, near or within the *LYPLAL1* gene.

2. **Associated Traits**: 
   - rs704341 has been associated with body fat distribution, particularly with differences in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), independent of overall body mass index (BMI). This suggests it may play a role in how fat is distributed in the body, rather than overall obesity.
   - The SNP has been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as influencing fat distribution primarily in women, highlighting possible sex-specific genetic effects.

3. **Clinical Relevance**:
   - Variants like rs704341 may offer insights into the genetic basis of diseases linked to fat distribution, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, which are associated with central adiposity.

4. **Alleles**:
   - rs704341 represents a variation at a specific base in the DNA sequence, and the alleles are often denoted as the reference (major) allele and the alternate (minor) allele.
   - Specific risk or protective alleles may vary depending on population studies.

5. **Research Impacts**:
   - Understanding SNPs like rs704341 can help unravel the genetic underpinnings of fat distribution and metabolic disease risk, potentially leading to personalized medicine approaches.
