Sure! rs796052984 is the reference SNP ID for a specific genetic variant associated with the *PCSK9* gene, which plays a key role in regulating cholesterol levels. This variant is commonly known as *PCSK9* p.Arg46Leu (R46L), a missense mutation where an arginine (R) is replaced by a leucine (L) at position 46 of the protein. This substitution results in reduced function of the PCSK9 protein.

**Key points about rs796052984:**

- **Gene**: *PCSK9* (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9)
- **Type of Variant**: Missense mutation (a single nucleotide change resulting in an amino acid substitution)
- **Protein Change**: Arginine (R) â†’ Leucine (L) at position 46
- **Effect**: Loss-of-function mutation, associated with increased clearance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from the bloodstream.
- **Clinical Relevance**: This variant is correlated with lower LDL-C levels and a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease. It is considered protective for heart health.
- **Population Frequency**: The allele frequency of this variant varies across populations, with higher frequencies observed in certain ancestry groups, such as those of European descent.

Variants in *PCSK9*, such as rs796052984, are of significant interest in the development of cholesterol-lowering therapies. PCSK9 inhibitors are a class of drugs designed to mimic the effects of loss-of-function mutations like R46L for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia and associated cardiovascular conditions.
