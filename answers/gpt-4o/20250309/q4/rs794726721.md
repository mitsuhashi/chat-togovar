The identifier **rs794726721** refers to a specific single nucleotide variant (SNV) cataloged in public genetic databases, such as dbSNP. Here is an overview of key details available about rs794726721:

1. **Variant Type**: It is a single nucleotide variant.

2. **Gene Association**: This variant is associated with the **LMNA** gene, which encodes lamin A and lamin C, structural proteins of the nuclear envelope. Mutations in LMNA are linked to various diseases known as laminopathies.

3. **Position and Sequence Change**: The variant corresponds to a substitution at **c.1580G>A** in the LMNA gene, which results in a **missense mutation** causing an amino acid change from **arginine (Arg, R)** to **histidine (His, H)** at protein position 527 (p.Arg527His).

4. **Clinical Relevance**: This variant is associated with **dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)** and shows autosomal dominant inheritance. DCM is a condition characterized by the enlargement and impaired pumping ability of the heart's ventricles, often leading to heart failure, arrhythmias, or other complications.

5. **Pathogenicity**: The clinical significance of rs794726721 has been classified as **"likely pathogenic"** in genetic reports sourced from databases such as ClinVar. This classification indicates strong evidence that the variant is related to disease phenotypes, particularly DCM.

6. **Population Frequency**: The population frequency of this variant appears to be very low or absent in large genomic cohorts like gnomAD, suggesting it is rare and potentially deleterious.

7. **Evidence Base**: The variant and its effects have been characterized in family studies and case reports. Functional studies of LMNA mutations suggest that alterations in the lamin protein structure can disrupt nuclear integrity, leading to various laminopathies.

### Summary
rs794726721 is a rare, likely pathogenic missense variant in the LMNA gene, associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. It results in the amino acid change p.Arg527His and has a significant impact on the structure and function of lamin proteins within the nuclear envelope.
