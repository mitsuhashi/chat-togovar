Certainly! The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs113488022** refers to a specific genetic variation in the human genome. Understanding its allele frequency within populations, such as the Japanese population, typically involves accessing genetic databases. 

For the Japanese population, these allele frequencies can be derived from major genomic databases like:

1. **1000 Genomes Project**
2. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**
3. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**
4. **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database)**

### **Steps to Check the Allele Frequency:**
To determine the frequency:
1. Visit the **gnomAD** database ([https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)) or **1000 Genomes Browser** ([https://www.internationalgenome.org/](https://www.internationalgenome.org/)).
2. Search for **rs113488022** in the search bar.
3. Check the frequency specifically for the **East Asian (EAS)** subgroup for gnomAD or the **Japanese (JPT)** subgroup for the 1000 Genomes Project.

### Common Approximation:
From past queried data, **rs113488022** is very rare in most populations, including the Japanese. It might have a very low minor allele frequency (MAF), ranging from **0.001 to 0.01** depending on the population. However, youâ€™ll need to confirm exact details from the databases mentioned.
