To provide the allele frequency of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs704341** in Japanese populations, we can reference publicly available genomic databases such as the **1000 Genomes Project**, **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**, or **dbSNP**. These repositories provide allele frequency information for different populations, including the Japanese population.

### Example Data Sources for rs704341
1. **1000 Genomes Project**:
   - Data from the "East Asian" (EAS) population includes sub-populations such as Japanese (JPT), Han Chinese, and others.
   - You can search rs704341 in the **Ensembl** genome browser (https://www.ensembl.org) or on the **1000 Genomes Project Browser** (http://www.internationalgenome.org/).

2. **gnomAD Database**:
   - gnomAD provides allele frequencies across diverse populations, including "East Asian" populations.

3. **Japanese-specific Genome Databases**:
   - **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**: A resource specifically focused on the Japanese population.
   - **JGVD (Japanese Genome Variation Database)**: https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp is another excellent resource for allele frequencies in the Japanese population.

### Allele Frequency from the 1000 Genomes Project
For rs704341:
- The **Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT)** sub-population from the 1000 Genomes Project often has allele frequency data.

#### Steps to Find the Exact Allele Frequency:
1. Use the rsID (rs704341) to query in one of the databases (Ensembl, gnomAD, or dbSNP).
2. Filter the data specifically for the "Japanese" or "East Asian" population.
