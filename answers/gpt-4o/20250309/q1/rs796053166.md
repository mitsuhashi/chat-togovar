The variant **rs796053166** is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). To find the allele frequency specifically in Japanese populations, researchers typically refer to population genetics databases such as the **Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)**, **1000 Genomes Project**, or **Japanese-specific databases** like the **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)** or the **Japonica Array**.

### Steps to Locate Allele Frequency of rs796053166 in Japanese Populations

1. **Check gnomAD** (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/):
   - Use the search bar in gnomAD to locate the variant **rs796053166**.
   - Look for the allele frequency table, which breaks down frequencies based on populations.
   - Find the statistics for the **East Asian population**, which often includes Japanese as a subgroup. However, gnomAD does not always provide Japanese-specific frequencies, so further steps may be needed.

2. **Check 1000 Genomes Project**:
   - The 1000 Genomes Project contains genetic data for individuals from populations worldwide, including the Japanese (JPT - Japanese in Tokyo, Japan).
   - Visit the **Ensembl Genome Browser** (https://www.ensembl.org/) and search for rs796053166. Look in the "1000 Genomes Project Allele Frequencies" section for frequencies in JPT samples.

3. **Check ToMMo or Other Japanese Databases**:
   - **ToMMo** provides allele frequency data specifically for Japanese populations. You may need to access their database through their official portal (https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/) and search for rs796053166.
   - Alternatively, **Japonica Array** (https://japonicaarray.jp/) may also include frequency data for rs796053166 in a Japanese-specific context.

### What to Do if No Japanese-Specific Data is Found
If the SNP of interest (rs796053166) does not have Japanese-specific allele frequency data in public or accessible databases, it may indicate that:
- The variant is extremely rare and not well-documented in that population.
- Additional analyses, such as sequencing data from Japanese samples, may be required to obtain accurate frequencies.

Feel free to ask if you'd like guidance on accessing any of these databases or interpreting the data!
