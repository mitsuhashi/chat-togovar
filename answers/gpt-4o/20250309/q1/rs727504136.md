Certainly! The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs727504136** can be found in public genomic databases such as the **1000 Genomes Project** or **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**. However, the allele frequency in Japanese populations may differ depending on the specific dataset used.

I have summarized the general steps to check for the allele frequency for rs727504136 in Japanese populations:

1. **Visit gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)**:
   - Search for rs727504136 in the search bar.
   - Navigate to the "Population Frequencies" section.
   - Look specifically at the East Asian (EAS) population, as it includes data from Japanese individuals as well as other East Asian populations (e.g., Chinese and Korean).

2. **Access 1000 Genomes Project data**:
   - Visit the Ensembl website (https://www.ensembl.org/).
   - Search for rs727504136 in the search bar.
   - Look under the population genetics section, focusing on the "EAS" superpopulation or "Japanese in Tokyo (JPT)" population for allele frequency information.

If you want me to help you interpret data from a specific source or if you'd like me to find real-time information for this SNP (based on existing datasets), let me know, and I can guide you further!
