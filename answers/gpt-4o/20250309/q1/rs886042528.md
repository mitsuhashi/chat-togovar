Certainly! The specific allele frequency of the genetic variant **rs886042528** in a Japanese population can be found in large population genomics databases such as:

1. **dbSNP by NCBI**: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)
    - Use the search box to look for **rs886042528**, and check the "Allele Frequency" section for population-specific data.
  
2. **gnomAD (The Genome Aggregation Database)**: [https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)
    - If this variant has been cataloged, gnomAD houses allele frequency data for many populations, including East Asians (which include Japanese individuals). However, gnomAD doesn't always provide country-specific frequencies.

3. **ToMMo (Japanese-specific database)**: [https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/](https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/)
    - The Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization offers specific allele frequency data for Japanese populations. This is one of the most accurate resources for Japanese-specific genomic information.

4. **1000 Genomes Project**: [https://www.internationalgenome.org/](https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
   - The project includes data for the Japanese in Tokyo (JPT) population, which might include frequencies for rs886042528.
