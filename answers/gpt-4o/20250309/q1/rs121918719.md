The SNP **rs121918719**, also known as the L858R mutation in the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene, is a well-known mutation associated with certain types of lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is generally rare in the normal population and predominantly occurs as a somatic mutation in tumor samples, rather than as a germline variant in healthy individuals.

### Allele Frequency in Japanese Populations
As of the latest resources available (up to October 2023):

1. **GnomAD Database**:
   - The **rs121918719** SNP is not commonly observed in general population databases that include Japanese or other East Asian populations. It may not have a significant allele frequency reported in large-scale population data such as gnomAD Exomes or Genomes, since it is primarily studied as a **somatic mutation** in cancer studies rather than being frequently found in healthy individuals.

2. **Cancer-Specific Studies**:
   - In Japanese populations, the **EGFR L858R mutation** (rs121918719) has been reported at high frequencies in certain types of **lung adenocarcinomas**, especially in patients who are non-smokers or females. Published literature suggests that **50% or more of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cases** in Japan may carry the L858R mutation. However, this is in the context of somatic mutation analysis (tumor DNA), not the germline allele frequency in the general population.

3. If this SNP were assessed in healthy individuals in Japanese populations:
   - The allele frequency would likely be **extremely rare to non-existent**, as reported in databases like gnomAD, because it is generally considered a pathogenic driver mutation that arises somatically in cancer.

### How to Access the Data:
If you want to confirm the most recent allele frequency data for rs121918719 specifically in the germline DNA of Japanese individuals:
- Check databases such as **gnomAD** (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), and filter for the East Asian population.
- Refer to population-specific genome databases, such as the **Japanese Genome Variation Consortium (JGVC)** or **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**, for more detailed statistics on germline variants in Japanese populations.
