The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs876660744 is specific genetic variation, and its allele frequency in different populations can be obtained through public genomic databases.

For population-specific allele frequencies, including Japanese populations, you should check databases like:

1. **dbSNP (NCBI):** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)  
   - Search for rs876660744 in dbSNP for variant details and population data.

2. **1000 Genomes Project:** [https://www.internationalgenome.org](https://www.internationalgenome.org)  
   - Provides allele frequencies across global populations, including East Asian (EAS), which reflects Japanese populations.

3. **Japanese-specific databases:**
   - **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank):** [https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp)  
     A project with genetic frequency data for Japanese.
   - **JGVD (Japanese Genome Variation Database):** [https://imgmg.org/jgvd/](https://imgmg.org/jgvd/)

To find allele frequency for rs876660744 in Japanese populations, search any of these resources to retrieve frequency data. If the specific SNP is not listed in the database, it may indicate limited or no observed occurrence in Japanese population studies.
