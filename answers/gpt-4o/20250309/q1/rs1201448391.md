The allele frequency of a specific genetic variant, such as **rs1201448391**, can vary across populations, including individuals of Japanese ancestry. To find the most accurate and up-to-date allele frequency data for this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Japanese population or other populations, you can consult publicly available genomic databases like those listed below:

#### 1. **dbSNP (NCBI)**:
   - [dbSNP database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)
   - Navigate to the rsID page (search for **rs1201448391**) and check frequency data listed under different populations, which may include Japanese data if available.

#### 2. **1000 Genomes Project**:
   - [1000 Genomes Browser](https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
   - Look for **rs1201448391** and review data for the **JPT** (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) population, which is part of the 1000 Genomes dataset.

#### 3. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**:
   - [ToMMo Database](https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/)
   - This resource specifically provides allele frequency data from large-scale sequencing efforts in Japanese individuals.

#### 4. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**:
   - [gnomAD Browser](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)
   - Search for **rs1201448391** to find allele frequency data across various populations, including East Asians, which may include Japanese individuals.

#### 5. **Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD)**:
   - [HGVD Database](https://www.hgvd.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/)
   - This database provides information on genetic variation specific to the Japanese population.

### How to Proceed:
- If the variant **rs1201448391** does not appear in Japanese-specific studies or databases, it may be rare or absent in these populations.
- If you cannot find the data after searching, consider the possibility that it has not been genotyped in those studies or is newly identified.
