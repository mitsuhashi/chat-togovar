The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs1170153450** appears to be relatively uncommon, and verifying its exact allele frequency in specific populations, such as the Japanese population, requires consulting population-specific genetic studies or large-scale genomic repositories.

Here are some resources you can use to check the allele frequency in Japanese populations:

1. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**: This database provides allele frequency information across numerous populations, including East Asians. You can search for **rs1170153450** at the [gnomAD Browser](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).

2. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**: This is a Japanese genomic database that contains allele frequency data specific to the Japanese population. It’s a highly relevant resource for studying population-specific genetic variations. Visit the [ToMMo website](https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english) for access.

3. **The 1000 Genomes Project**: This project provides allele frequency data for multiple populations, including the Japanese from Tokyo (JPT) population. You can find information for specific SNPs like **rs1170153450** on the [Ensembl website](https://www.ensembl.org) or the 1000 Genomes browser.

4. **dbSNP (NCBI SNP Database)**: This is a comprehensive resource to find basic information about SNPs, including allele frequencies across different populations. Check out [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) for the SNP of interest.

#### What to Do:
Search for **rs1170153450** in these resources and ensure you filter for allele frequencies specific to Japanese or East Asian populations. If the SNP is rare, it may not be well-documented or observed in studies to date.
