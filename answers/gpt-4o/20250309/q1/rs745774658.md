The SNP **rs745774658** is a specific variant of DNA, and its allele frequency can vary across different populations, including the Japanese. To find detailed allele frequencies, population-specific databases can be referred to, such as:

1. **1000 Genomes Project**:
   This international genomics database provides allele frequency data from diverse global populations, including East Asians (EAS), which includes Japanese individuals.

2. **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database)**:  
   This Japanese-specific genetic database may provide allele frequency information for rs745774658 in the Japanese population.

3. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**:  
   The gnomAD database contains allele frequency data from different populations, including East Asians. Check the dataset for the "EAS" population or narrower Japanese-specific data (if present).

4. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**:  
   This Japanese population-specific biobank focuses on the genetic architecture of the Japanese people and may have the allele frequency for rs745774658.

As I do not have real-time access to external databases, you will need to consult one of the aforementioned resources for the precise allele frequency of rs745774658 in Japanese populations. If you let me know which tools or databases you're most comfortable using, I can guide you on how to search for this variant!
