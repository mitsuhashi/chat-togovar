Certainly! According to the publicly available genomic databases like the **gnomAD** (Genome Aggregation Database) or **dbSNP** (NCBI), allele frequencies for individual variants such as **rs763684724** can vary across populations.

If we look into the gnomAD database for rs763684724 specifically:

1. **Global Frequency**: The overall allele frequency across all populations.
2. **East Asian Frequency**: This includes Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and other East Asian populations.
3. **Japanese-Specific Frequency**: If available, some databases like **ToMMo** (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization) or **HGVD** (Human Genetic Variation Database) provide Japanese-specific allele frequency.

You can check these updated allele frequencies by:

- Visiting gnomAD: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/
- Searching for rs763684724.
- Looking specifically at the "East Asian" breakdown for an approximate frequency within a Japanese subset.
- Alternatively, for fine-tuned Japanese frequencies, use ToMMo's or HGVD's online database and query rs763684724.

Please note that the presence or absence of the SNP in databases and its reported frequency can vary due to population sampling and inclusion criteria.
