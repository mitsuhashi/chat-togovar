The allele frequency of a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) like **rs1235072590** in a specific population, such as Japanese populations, can typically be retrieved from public genomic databases. Here are the steps on how you can look up this information:

### 1. **Check the dbSNP Database**  
- Visit the [NCBI dbSNP website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp).
- Enter **rs1235072590** in the search bar.
- Look for the "Global Allele Frequency" section, which often includes frequencies across different populations, including Japanese if available.

### 2. **Refer to gnomAD**  
- Go to the [gnomAD browser](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
- Search for **rs1235072590** in the search bar.
- Check the allele frequency for the "East Asian" population, which includes Japanese individuals.

### 3. **Japanese-Specific Resources**  
For allele frequencies specific to Japanese populations, consult:
   - **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**: The Japanese Reference Genome source provides allele frequency data for the Japanese population. [ToMMo Genome Browser](https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/2021/).
   - **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database)**: A Japanese-specific genome variation database. [HGVD website](http://www.hgvd.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/).

### Note  
If you're unable to find this information directly, the SNP might not have reported frequency data for the Japanese population, or it may not be directly included in studies that cover genetic diversity in Japanese cohorts.
