As of my last knowledge cutoff in October 2023, **rs1489788269** (a specific single-nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP) does not appear in major publicly available databases such as dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, or gnomAD. If this SNP exists, its population frequency data may not be widely available or may not have been studied yet, particularly in the context of Japanese populations.

To ascertain the allele frequency of **rs1489788269** in Japanese populations, you can follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Check dbSNP Database**
The dbSNP database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) is a centralized repository of SNP data. Search for rs1489788269 in the database to see if it has known frequency data for any population, including Japanese individuals.

---

### 2. **Access gnomAD**
The gnomAD database (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org) contains extensive allele frequency data from multiple populations, including East Asians. Use the search bar to look up rs1489788269 and filter for population-specific frequencies.

---

### 3. **Browse Japan-Specific Databases**
Japan has its own genomic databases that specifically provide allele frequency data for genetic variants in Japanese populations. Examples include:
   - **JGaP (Japanese Genome Variation Panel)**: Managed by the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC).
   - **ToMMo 8.3KJPN or 14KJPN**: Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization (ToMMo) provides allele frequency data for thousands of Japanese individuals. Visit their website (ToMMo variant browser) and search for this SNP.

---

### 4. **Check Publications in Genomic Studies**
Search for recent scientific articles or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving Japanese populations. PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a good starting point. Keywords like "rs1489788269 Japanese allele frequency" may yield relevant studies.

---

### 5. **Contact Database Managers**
If the SNP is rare or novel, allele frequency data may not currently be available in public databases. You could contact the researchers or groups responsible for hosting Japanese genome data, such as ToMMo or JGaP.
