The SNP rs794726721 is relatively rare, and allele frequency information may not be available in all studies or population databases. To check the allele frequency of rs794726721 in Japanese populations, you can look at large genomic databases that provide population-level frequency data, such as:

1. **GnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)** - This database provides allele frequency data across multiple populations, including East Asians, which might include Japanese individuals. You can search for rs794726721 in GnomAD to check its frequency in the "EAS" (East Asian) population.

2. **ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)** - This Japanese-specific database collects genomic data from the Japanese population. It may provide allele frequency data specific to Japan.

3. **dbSNP (NCBI's Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)** - You can search for rs794726721 in dbSNP to find allele frequencies if they are available for East Asians or Japanese samples.

4. **HGVD (Human Genetic Variation Database)** - This is a Japanese-specific resource that contains allele frequency data for variants observed in the Japanese population.

If you are unable to locate the exact allele frequency for rs794726721 using these resources, it may indicate that this SNP has not been studied extensively in the Japanese population or that it is very rare (or absent) in that population.
