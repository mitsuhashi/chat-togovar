The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs571414497 can have varying allele frequencies depending on the population studied. To find the allele frequency of rs571414497 specifically in Japanese populations, you would need to consult publicly available genomic databases or resources that provide allele frequency data for different populations.

A few widely used databases you can check are:

### 1. **1000 Genomes Project**
   - The 1000 Genomes Project provides allele frequency data for various populations, including the Japanese.
   - The Japanese population is often categorized as "JPT" (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) within this database.

### 2. **gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)**
   - gnomAD contains allele frequency information across a wide range of populations, including East Asians (EAS). This grouping includes Japanese, Chinese, and other East Asian populations.

### 3. **dbSNP**
   - The dbSNP database hosted by NCBI provides SNP-specific data, including information on population allele frequencies.

### 4. **HapMap Project**
   - Although older, HapMap has subsets of allele frequency data for some populations, including Japanese.

### Steps to Check:
1. Visit the relevant database (e.g., gnomAD: [https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org)).
2. Search for rs571414497 in the search bar.
3. Find allele frequency data specific to East Asians (EAS) or Japanese (JPT).
