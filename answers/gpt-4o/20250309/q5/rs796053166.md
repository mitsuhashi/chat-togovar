The single nucleotide variant (SNV) **rs796053166** is located in the **GJB2** gene, which encodes the connexin 26 protein. This gene is well known for its critical role in hearing, as it is implicated in maintaining the potassium ion balance necessary for signal transduction in the cochlea. Variants in the GJB2 gene are the most common genetic cause of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). Specifically, rs796053166 corresponds to the **p.Tyr248Ter** change (c.744C>A) in GJB2. This leads to a premature termination codon, resulting in a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

### Variants Similar to rs796053166 in GJB2:

Variants in GJB2 that are predicted to cause **loss of function** (LoF) by truncating the connexin 26 protein, disrupting its structure, or impairing its function in gap junctions, produce similar effects to rs796053166. These variants are typically associated with hearing loss. Examples include:

---

#### 1. **Truncating (Nonsense) Variants**:
These variants create a premature stop codon, leading to shortened, nonfunctional proteins.
- **rs80338943**: p.Trp24Ter (c.72G>A)  
  - This nonsense mutation leads to a highly truncated protein that causes autosomal recessive hearing loss.
  
- **rs397517016**: p.Arg127Ter (c.379C>T)  
  - The premature stop codon results in a nonfunctional protein associated with hearing loss.

- **rs78769559**: p.Arg143Ter (c.427C>T)  
  - Another nonsense mutation associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss.

---

#### 2. **Frameshift Variants**:
These variants result in shifts in the reading frame, producing aberrant proteins or triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD):
- **rs80338944**: c.35delG (p.Gly12ValfsTer2)
  - One of the most common pathogenic variants worldwide, especially in people of European ancestry, leading to early truncation of the protein.
  
- **rs72474224**: c.167delT (p.Leu56ArgfsTer26)  
  - Causes a frameshift, resulting in a truncated connexin 26 protein.

---

#### 3. **Splice-Site Variants**:
These variants affect splicing, leading to exon skipping or aberrant mRNA transcripts that can produce nonfunctional proteins.
- **rs80338939**: c.-23+1G>A (IVS1+1G>A)  
  - A common splice-site variant that disrupts splicing and results in hearing loss.

- **c.235delC (p.Leu79CysfsTer3)** *(unregistered in dbSNP but well-documented)*  
  - Common in East Asian populations, this deletion alters splicing and leads to deafness.

---

#### 4. **Missense Variants with Severe Functional Effects**:
While not truncating, some missense variants in GJB2 may severely impair the function of the connexin 26 protein to a degree similar to LoF variants.
- **rs80338945**: p.Met34Thr (c.101T>C)  
  - A common variant with reduced gap junction channel function, often associated with mild to moderate hearing loss when biallelic with a LoF variant.

- **rs80338947**: p.Val37Ile (c.109G>A)  
  - A mild missense variant that can contribute to hearing loss when compounded with severe truncating variants like rs796053166.

---

#### 5. **Compound Heterozygosity**:
In many cases of autosomal recessive hearing loss, individuals are compound heterozygotes, carrying one truncating variant (like rs796053166) alongside another truncating or a missense variant. These combinations can explain the phenotypic spectrum, ranging from mild to profound hearing loss.

### Summary:
Variants similar to rs796053166—the p.Tyr248Ter change—include other **loss of function truncating mutations** (nonsense or frameshift) and severe splice-site variants in the **GJB2** gene. These variants disrupt functional connexin 26 protein and are commonly associated with hereditary hearing loss, specifically autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss.
