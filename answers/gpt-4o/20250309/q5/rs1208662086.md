To assist effectively, let me briefly provide context about rs1208662086.

The identifier **rs1208662086** refers to a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human genome, which is cataloged within key public genomic databases like dbSNP. Variants like rs1208662086 can have variable impacts on genes, proteins, and biological pathways depending on the genomic context, such as the location (coding or noncoding region), molecular consequences (e.g., missense, nonsense, splicing), or associated phenotypes.

If you're interested in variants with **"similar effects"** to rs1208662086, the search depends on:

1. **Genomic Location**: 
   - If rs1208662086 lies within or near a specific gene (e.g., in coding regions or regulatory elements), similar variants would include those within the same region that perturb gene expression or function similarly.

2. **Predicted or Known Functional Consequences**:
   - For example, if rs1208662086 is a **missense variant** (causing an amino acid substitution), variants in the same gene or paralogous genes causing similar amino acid changes at conserved sites would be relevant.
   - If rs1208662086 is a **regulatory variant** altering transcription factor binding or splicing, similar variants would include those in other regulatory regions influencing the same gene or pathway.

3. **Associated Phenotypes**:
   - If rs1208662086 is tied to a specific phenotype or disease, e.g., via a genome-wide association study (GWAS), similar variants would include those with associations to the same trait or condition.

4. **Clinical Significance**:
   - Variants with similar impacts may have the same clinical significance, classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, or uncertain significance.

### How to Find Similar Variants to rs1208662086:

1. **Filter Variants by Genomic Features**:
   Check variants in or near the same **gene** or functional region using:
   - **gnomAD:** Population frequency data for variants in specific genes/regions.
   - **dbSNP:** To identify nearby SNPs or structural variants.
   - **RegulomeDB** or **Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP):** To explore regulatory and functional annotations.

2. **Variants with Similar Predicted Consequences**:
   If rs1208662086 is a missense mutation, use tools like:
   - **PolyPhen-2**, **SIFT**, or **CADD** to find other likely deleterious variants in the same gene or functionally related genes.
   - If it's a splicing or regulatory variant, use **SpliceAI** or conservation scores like PhyloP/PhastCons.

3. **Phenotypically or Pathway-Similar Variants**:
   Use information from databases or computational tools to identify variants tied to similar phenotypes:
   - **ClinVar**: Search for clinically relevant variants in the same condition or phenotype.
   - **GWAS Catalog**: To map variants associated with the same trait.

4. **Pathway-Enriched Variants**:
   If rs1208662086 affects a specific biological pathway:
   - Investigate **pathway enrichment** using tools like Reactome or IPA.
   - Look for variants impacting the same pathway, gene network, or interactions (e.g., through STRING or GeneMANIA).
