The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12037987 is associated with the **growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5)** gene, located on chromosome 20 (20q11.22). GDF5 is a key regulatory gene involved in skeletal and joint development, and variants near this gene have been linked to conditions such as **osteoarthritis** and **height variation**. The rs12037987 SNP is specifically associated with osteoarthritis risk in various populations, as well as with differences in anthropometric traits, such as stature.

If you're searching for other variants that have similar effects as rs12037987 (e.g., influencing osteoarthritis susceptibility, joint-related diseases, or height variability), here are several notable examples:

---

### 1. **rs143383** (GDF5 Gene)
- **Variant Type**: SNP located in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the GDF5 gene.
- **Effects**: One of the most well-characterized variants in GDF5 with a strong association with osteoarthritis in multiple ethnic populations. This SNP is linked to reduced GDF5 expression in joint tissues, leading to susceptibility to osteoarthritis.
- **Similarities to rs12037987**: Both rs12037987 and rs143383 are located in or near the GDF5 locus and influence osteoarthritis risk and GDF5 gene regulation.

### 2. **rs6060369** (Linkage Disequilibrium with GDF5 Variants)
- **Variant Type**: Intergenic SNP near GDF5.
- **Effects**: Identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as associated with knee and hip osteoarthritis. It likely works in concert with other GDF5-related SNPs.
- **Similarities to rs12037987**: Functionally related to osteoarthritis predisposition and possibly linked to the same regulatory pathways in cartilage development.

### 3. **rs4730250** (Chromosome 17, SOX9 Gene)
- **Variant Type**: Intronic SNP in the SOX9 gene.
- **Effects**: Another genetic region implicated in height determination and joint/cartilage development. SOX9 interacts with GDF5-related developmental pathways.
- **Similarities to rs12037987**: While not in the GDF5 locus, it plays a similar role in skeletal development, affecting height and joint function.

### 4. **rs10432980** (SMAD3 Gene)
- **Variant Type**: SNP located in SMAD3, a key participant in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway.
- **Effects**: Linked to osteoarthritis, cartilage formation, and joint health through TGF-β interactions. SMAD3 modulates downstream signaling pathways that can overlap with GDF5 functions.
- **Similarities to rs12037987**: Both mediate joint health and osteoarthritis susceptibility through overlapping regulatory pathways.

### 5. **rs7751940** (DOT1L Gene)
- **Variant Type**: SNP in the DOT1L gene, found through osteoarthritis GWAS.
- **Effects**: Associated with reduced risk of osteoarthritis and increased height. DOT1L is thought to modulate key regulatory mechanisms in cartilage and bone development.
- **Similarities to rs12037987**: Involved in osteoarthritis risk modification and height-related pathways.

### Broader Linkage Context:
The effects of rs12037987 often occur in the context of **regulatory polymorphisms** that impact cartilage development or chondrogenesis. Many variants in signaling pathways, such as GDF5 (bone morphogenesis) or TGF-β (growth regulation), exhibit overlapping or synergetic effects. Analyzing these variants collectively in genomic studies provides a more complete understanding of joint disease risk and skeletal phenotypes, such as height.
