The variant *rs121913279* is a well-known pathogenic mutation in the *TP53* gene, specifically c.743G>A (p.Arg248Gln). It leads to the replacement of an arginine (R) with a glutamine (Q) at codon 248 in the DNA-binding domain of the TP53 protein, which is critical to its tumor suppressor function.

Since *TP53* is a master regulator of cell cycle control and apoptosis, mutations in this gene often result in loss or alteration of function, contributing to cancer development. Codon 248 is a mutational hotspot in *TP53*, and variants in this position can disrupt DNA binding, which significantly impairs the protein’s ability to regulate downstream target genes.

**Similar-Effect Variants in TP53:**
Other *TP53* mutations with effects akin to rs121913279 involve alterations within the DNA-binding domain or mutations at mutational hotspots, leading to dysfunctional protein or a dominant-negative effect. Notable examples include:

### 1. **Mutations at codon 248 (hotspot for mutation)**
   - **rs28934575 (c.743G>T, p.Arg248Leu):** Also alters codon 248, substituting arginine with leucine. This variant disrupts DNA-binding and abolishes transcriptional activity of TP53’s target genes.
   - **Other rare variants affecting codon 248:** Mutations at this position generally disrupt the structural integrity of TP53 or prevent it from binding DNA.

### 2. **Other DNA-binding domain mutations**
   - **rs28934576 (c.818G>A, p.Arg273His):** Mutation of arginine at codon 273, another critical residue in DNA binding, linked to multiple cancers.
   - **rs28934574 (c.818G>C, p.Arg273Pro):** Substitution of proline for arginine also abrogates DNA-binding.
   - **rs121912651 (c.524G>A, p.Arg175His):** Codon 175 is located within the DNA-binding domain and is one of the most frequently mutated residues in TP53 in human cancers.

### 3. **Mutations causing similar functional effects**
   - Variants causing loss of TP53 transcriptional activity or dominant-negative effects. These mutations frequently occur at sites directly involved in DNA binding or inducing conformational changes that destabilize the protein structure.

**Functional Consequences:**
- Many of these mutations result in a loss of function, dominant-negative activity, or even gain-of-function (GOF) effects, where the mutant protein interferes with the normal activity of wild-type TP53 or acquires oncogenic properties.

**Phenotypes Associated with Similar Variants:**
- Variants like rs121913279 are strongly associated with predisposition to cancers, including:
  - Li-Fraumeni syndrome (hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome)
  - Sporadic cancers (e.g., breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma)

### Broad Classifications
Variants that mimic the effects of rs121913279 generally fall into three broad categories:
1. **DNA-binding domain hotspots** (e.g., codons 175, 245, 248, 273, and 282).
2. **Structural mutations** that destabilize the protein.
3. **Gain-of-function mutations** that promote oncogenic activity.
