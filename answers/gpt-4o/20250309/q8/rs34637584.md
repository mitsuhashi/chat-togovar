The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs34637584** is located in the **CFTR** (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene and has been implicated in the modulation of transcript expression and splicing. The key effects of rs34637584 are tied to its influence on splicing efficiency, particularly in the context of certain isoforms of the **CFTR** pre-mRNA.

### Context of rs34637584
- **rs34637584** corresponds to the missense mutation **c.3453G>C** in exon 22 (also referred to as exon 23 in some nomenclatures) of the **CFTR gene**, resulting in the amino acid change **(D1152H)**.
- While it is primarily considered a mild mutation that does not typically cause classical cystic fibrosis (CF) on its own, it has been associated with **atypical CF phenotypes** and **CF-related disorders**, like congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) or mild respiratory symptoms.

### Mechanisms Affecting Transcript Expression:
1. **Splicing Modulation:**
   - The introduction of the **D1152H (c.3453G>C)** mutation can alter exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) or silencers, which are sequence elements critical for the binding of splicing factors.
   - **rs34637584** may reduce the efficiency of exon 22 inclusion during pre-mRNA splicing, leading to lower levels of the full-length, properly spliced CFTR transcript.

2. **Reduced Transcript Stability or Protein Levels:**
   - Even when exon 22 is included, the D1152H missense mutation may subtly alter protein folding or processing, leading to lower functional levels of the CFTR protein.
   - This variant often results in reduced CFTR protein activity or residual function, especially when paired with another severe CFTR mutation.

3. **CFTR-Related Disease Phenotypes:**
   - In compound heterozygous cases (e.g., rs34637584 paired with a severe CF-causing mutation like F508del), rs34637584 can result in partial transcript and protein function, contributing to variability in disease severity.
   - Some studies suggest that this variant may also decrease the total CFTR mRNA expression through unknown regulatory effects.

### Clinical Implications:
- **CF Diagnostic Testing:** rs34637584 is classified as a **residual function mutation**. Its effect on transcript splicing and expression can lead to variability in clinical outcomes.
- **Therapeutic Considerations:** Individuals with this variant may benefit from CFTR modulators, such as **ivacaftor** or combination therapies like **tezacaftor/ivacaftor** or **elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta)**, which aim to improve CFTR protein folding, trafficking, or channel gating.

In summary, **rs34637584 modifies CFTR transcript expression by affecting splicing efficiency and overall transcript and protein levels.** Its effects are most pronounced when combined with other CFTR disease-causing mutations.
