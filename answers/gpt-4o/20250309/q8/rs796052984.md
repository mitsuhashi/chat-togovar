The single nucleotide variant **rs796052984** refers to a specific genetic change whose impact on transcript expression depends on its genomic context, the affected gene, and its functional consequence. At a high level, the way rs796052984 influences transcript expression depends on several factors:

### 1. **Location of the Variant**:
   - **Promoter or Enhancer Region**: If rs796052984 is located in a regulatory region, such as a promoter or enhancer, it could influence the binding of transcription factors or regulatory proteins. This may increase or decrease the transcription of the gene it regulates.
   - **Intronic Region**: If the variant is located within an intron, it could impact splicing by altering splicing regulatory elements (e.g., splice enhancers or silencers). This could lead to changes in the intron retention, exon skipping, or production of alternate transcript isoforms.
   - **Exonic Region**:
     - If rs796052984 causes a synonymous change (no change to the amino acid sequence), it may still influence mRNA stability or splicing.
     - If it is a nonsynonymous change, it could indirectly affect transcript levels by modifying protein function and potentially triggering feedback regulations.
     - If it introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense variant), it may trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), reducing transcript levels.
   - **3′ or 5′ UTR (Untranslated Regions)**: Variants in these regions can impact transcript stability, translation efficiency, or miRNA binding, indirectly altering transcript expression levels.

### 2. **Functional Annotation of rs796052984**:
A review of functional genomics databases, such as Ensembl, dbSNP, or regulatory feature predictions, would help clarify whether rs796052984 has experimentally validated effects on transcript expression. Functional assays, such as those measuring mRNA abundance via RT-qPCR or RNA-seq in cells carrying this variant, provide direct evidence.

### 3. **Gene Context**:
The specific gene associated with rs796052984 is important to determine how the variant could influence transcription. If the gene is under tight regulation (e.g., due to developmental or tissue-specific expression), regulatory variants like rs796052984 might have more pronounced effects.

### 4. **Population-Specific Effects**:
rs796052984 could exhibit population-specific effects or linkage disequilibrium with other variants that influence transcript expression. Integrating this variant into population-level genome-wide association studies (eQTL analysis) can reveal relationships with altered gene expression.

### 5. **Databases and eQTL Analysis**:
Public resources, such as GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression), Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), and dbSNP, can provide insights into whether rs796052984 is associated with changes in transcript levels across tissues (eQTLs). For example, GTEx can show if rs796052984 alters the expression of its host gene or neighboring genes in a tissue-specific manner.

### How to Investigate Further:
- **Experimental Validation**: Functional experiments (e.g., RNA-seq, luciferase reporter assays) need to be conducted to confirm its influence on gene expression.
- **Prediction Tools**: Use software tools like RegulomeDB, HaploReg, or CADD to predict the regulatory or functional impact of rs796052984.
- **Public Databases**: Search for information about the variant in:
  - NCBI dbSNP: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/
  - Ensembl Variant Browser: https://www.ensembl.org/
