rs794727152 is a variant in the **CFTR gene**, specifically a deletion mutation commonly referred to as **c.1521_1523delCTT** or **p.Phe508del (F508del)**. This mutation is widely associated with **cystic fibrosis (CF)**, a recessive genetic disorder caused by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Understanding how this mutation affects transcript expression is critical to understanding its role in disease.

### Mechanism by Which rs794727152 Impacts Transcript Expression
1. **Effect on CFTR Protein Folding:**  
   The F508del mutation causes the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 of the CFTR protein. This results in abnormal protein folding, leading to misprocessing and degradation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum during translation. The mutation does not directly affect the transcription of CFTR mRNA, but it significantly impacts downstream protein function.

2. **Feedback Regulation of CFTR mRNA Expression:**  
   Some studies have suggested that disruptions in CFTR protein stability or function at the cellular level can result in secondary effects on CFTR transcription. For instance:
   - Protein misfolding and degradation can trigger cellular stress responses, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR), which has the potential to modulate CFTR transcript levels.
   - In CF patient-derived cells with F508del homozygosity, altered signaling pathways may indirectly impact the mRNA expression levels. However, this effect varies based on cell type and experimental conditions.

3. **Impact on Splicing and CFTR Variants:**  
   The rs794727152/F508del mutation itself does not directly alter splicing processes; however, it sometimes exists alongside other splicing variants that could influence the overall transcript levels and isoform diversity of CFTR expression. This context-dependent effect should be studied in combination with other variants of interest.

4. **Secondary Cellular Adaptations in CF:**  
   Persistent misfolding of the CFTR protein in F508del homozygous individuals often causes chronic inflammation, altered ion transport, and disease pathology in epithelial tissues (e.g., lungs, pancreas, intestines). Whether these changes can feedback to affect CFTR transcript expression directly is not entirely clear but could be an area for further investigation.

### Research Evidence and Therapeutic Implications:
- Therapeutics aimed at partially rescuing the F508del CFTR protein, such as **correctors (e.g., lumacaftor, tezacaftor)** and **potentiators (e.g., ivacaftor)**, generally target protein folding, trafficking, and channel gating rather than directly altering transcript levels. However, these treatments could indirectly stabilize CFTR transcripts by mitigating cellular stress and degradation pathways.
- Transcriptomic studies analyzing CF patient samples have reported differential expression of other genes in the respiratory epithelium, which could provide clues about secondary changes to mRNA levels caused by F508del-related dysfunction.

In summary, rs794727152 does not directly impair CFTR transcript production or stability but primarily disrupts CFTR protein folding and stability. Changes in transcript expression may occur as a downstream adaptive response in the cellular environment of CF patients.
