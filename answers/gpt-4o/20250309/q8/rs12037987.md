The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs12037987** is located in the intronic region of the **TSHZ3** gene (teashirt zinc finger homeobox 3). Its functional impact on transcript expression has been studied in relation to various biological processes and disorders.

**Effect on Transcript Expression:**
The **rs12037987** SNP is known to be an **expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)**. Specifically:
- This SNP has been linked to changes in the expression levels of the TSHZ3 gene in certain tissues.
- As an intronic SNP, rs12037987 could affect **gene regulation** and **splicing patterns**, altering the production of TSHZ3 transcripts.
- eQTL studies from large-scale databases, such as **GTEx** (Genotype-Tissue Expression), show that variants near rs12037987 correlate with TSHZ3 expression levels in various tissues, suggesting it may have tissue-specific regulatory effects.

**Biological Importance:**
TSHZ3 is a critical transcriptional regulator involved in brain development and function. Disruption of TSHZ3 expression has been linked to **neurodevelopmental disorders**, such as **autism spectrum disorder (ASD)** and **cognitive impairment**. Therefore, the impact of rs12037987 on transcript expression may contribute to the understanding of such conditions.

**How to Evaluate Its Impact on Expression:**
To determine the exact role of rs12037987 in transcript regulation, here are a few approaches:
1. **eQTL Studies**: Check comprehensive databases like GTEx or ENCODE to analyze tissue-specific expression changes associated with this SNP.
2. **Functional Studies**: Perform luciferase assays or CRISPR/Cas9 editing to validate its regulatory potential.
3. **RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq)**: Compare transcriptomes across rs12037987 genotypes to detect differential transcript abundance or alternative splicing.
