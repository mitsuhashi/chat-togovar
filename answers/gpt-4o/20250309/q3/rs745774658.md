The location of a genetic variant, such as rs745774658, influences the clinical phenotype depending on the gene or genomic region in which it resides, as well as the specific impact of the variant on gene function or regulation. While there is no direct information available about rs745774658 itself in my knowledge base, here is a general guide to how the location of a variant can affect clinical outcomes:

1. **Coding Region (Exonic regions):**
   - If rs745774658 lies in a coding region of a gene, it could affect the protein sequence. Variants here can be:
     - **Missense variants:** Change one amino acid, potentially altering protein function.
     - **Nonsense variants:** Introduce a premature stop codon, possibly leading to a truncated, nonfunctional protein.
     - **Synonymous variants:** Do not change the amino acid sequence but may impact splicing or mRNA stability.
   - The specific phenotype depends on the role of the affected protein.

2. **Noncoding Regions:**
   - **Promoter or Enhancer Regions:** If rs745774658 is in a regulatory region, it might affect gene expression levels, altering the amount of protein produced.
   - **Intronic regions:** Variants here can disrupt splicing (creating aberrant transcripts) or influence regulatory elements like enhancers or silencers.
   - **Intergenic regions:** If located far from genes, rs745774658 may affect long-range regulatory elements (e.g., topologically associating domains or enhancers).

3. **Splice Sites:**
   - If rs745774658 is near splice donor/acceptor sites, it could disrupt normal splicing, leading to exon skipping, intron retention, or other splicing-related outcomes.

4. **Copy Number Variations or Structural Effects:**
   - If rs745774658 is part of a larger structural variant (e.g., a deletion or duplication), phenotypes may arise from altered gene dosage.

5. **Gene/Disease Association:**
   - The clinical significance of rs745774658 largely depends on whether it is associated with a specific disease. Research linking this variant to a disease (through Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), functional studies, or clinical reports) can clarify how it influences the phenotype.

6. **Zygosity:**
   - If rs745774658 is homozygous, heterozygous, or compound heterozygous, the clinical phenotype may differ in severity depending on the inheritance pattern and contribution of other alleles.

### To Determine rs745774658's Impact:
- **Review Literature and Databases:** Check resources such as ClinVar, dbSNP, gnomAD, or PubMed for studies about rs745774658.
- **Functional Studies:** Investigate the functional impact of the variant through laboratory studies or computational prediction tools (e.g., PolyPhen, SIFT).
- **Genetic Context:** Assess the location of rs745774658 relative to nearby genes and its potential regulatory impact.
