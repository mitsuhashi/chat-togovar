The single nucleotide variant **rs794726784** is associated with the *CYP2C9* gene, which encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of various drugs. Variants in *CYP2C9* are well-known to influence drug metabolism and response, particularly for medications metabolized by this enzyme, such as warfarin, phenytoin, and certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

### Key Points About rs794726784:
1. **Variant Information**: rs794726784 is a specific variant in the *CYP2C9* gene. It is also referred to as *CYP2C9* *R150H* (arginine to histidine substitution at position 150 of the protein).
2. **Functional Impact**: This variant has been reported to reduce the enzymatic activity of CYP2C9, which can lead to slower metabolism of drugs that are substrates of this enzyme.
3. **Drug Metabolism**: Reduced CYP2C9 activity can result in higher plasma concentrations of drugs, increasing the risk of adverse drug reactions or toxicity. For example:
   - **Warfarin**: Patients with reduced CYP2C9 activity may require lower doses of warfarin to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation and are at higher risk of bleeding complications.
   - **Phenytoin**: Impaired metabolism can lead to drug accumulation and toxicity.
   - **NSAIDs**: Slower metabolism may increase the risk of gastrointestinal or renal side effects.

### Clinical Relevance:
- **Pharmacogenetic Testing**: rs794726784 may be included in pharmacogenetic panels to guide drug dosing and selection, particularly for drugs metabolized by CYP2C9.
- **Guidelines**: The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and other organizations provide dosing guidelines for drugs like warfarin based on *CYP2C9* genotype, including variants like rs794726784.

### Recommendations:
- If you are a healthcare provider, consider pharmacogenetic testing for patients who are prescribed drugs metabolized by CYP2C9.
- If you are a patient, discuss with your healthcare provider whether genetic testing for *CYP2C9* variants, including rs794726784, might be beneficial for optimizing your medication regimen.
