The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs1235072590** is not well-documented in the current scientific literature or major pharmacogenomic databases as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023. This means there is no widely recognized evidence linking this specific variant to drug metabolism or response.

To determine whether rs1235072590 influences drug metabolism or response, you can take the following steps:

1. **Check Variant Databases**:
   - Search for rs1235072590 in databases like:
     - **dbSNP** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)
     - **ClinVar** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)
     - **PharmGKB** (https://www.pharmgkb.org/)
     - **Ensembl** (https://www.ensembl.org/)
   - These resources may provide information about the gene in which the SNP is located and any known associations with drug response.

2. **Gene Context**:
   - Identify the gene where rs1235072590 is located. If the SNP is in a gene known to be involved in drug metabolism (e.g., **CYP450 family**, **UGT**, **SLCO**, or **ABCB1**), it may have a potential role in pharmacogenomics.

3. **Literature Search**:
   - Perform a search in PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for studies mentioning rs1235072590. Use keywords like "rs1235072590 drug metabolism" or "rs1235072590 pharmacogenomics."

4. **Functional Annotation**:
   - Use tools like **RegulomeDB** (http://www.regulomedb.org/) or **GTEx** (https://gtexportal.org/home/) to assess whether rs1235072590 has regulatory effects on gene expression, which could indirectly influence drug response.

5. **Population Studies**:
   - If rs1235072590 is rare or population-specific, it may not yet have been studied extensively. Population-specific databases like gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) can provide allele frequency data.

If you have additional context, such as the gene or pathway associated with rs1235072590, I can help refine the search or provide more targeted insights. Let me know!
