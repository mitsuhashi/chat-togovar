The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs121913279** is a well-known variant in the **TPMT** (thiopurine S-methyltransferase) gene. This gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of thiopurine drugs, such as **azathioprine**, **6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)**, and **thioguanine**. These drugs are commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases, leukemia, and inflammatory bowel disease.

### Influence on Drug Metabolism and Response:
1. **Reduced TPMT Activity**: The rs121913279 variant is associated with significantly reduced or absent TPMT enzyme activity. This leads to impaired metabolism of thiopurine drugs, resulting in the accumulation of toxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) in the body.

2. **Increased Risk of Toxicity**: Individuals carrying this variant are at a higher risk of severe drug-related toxicities, such as:
   - **Myelosuppression** (bone marrow suppression)
   - **Leukopenia** (low white blood cell count)
   - **Hepatotoxicity** (liver damage)

3. **Pharmacogenomic Implications**: The presence of rs121913279 is a key factor in determining the appropriate dosage of thiopurine drugs. Patients with this variant often require significant dose reductions or alternative therapies to avoid adverse effects.

### Clinical Relevance:
- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation**: rs121913279 is one of the variants used to classify individuals into TPMT activity groups:
  - **Normal metabolizers**: Two functional TPMT alleles.
  - **Intermediate metabolizers**: One functional and one non-functional TPMT allele (e.g., heterozygous for rs121913279).
  - **Poor metabolizers**: Two non-functional TPMT alleles (e.g., homozygous for rs121913279).

- **Testing and Guidelines**: Pharmacogenomic testing for TPMT variants, including rs121913279, is recommended before initiating thiopurine therapy. Guidelines from organizations like the **Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)** provide dosing recommendations based on TPMT genotype.

### Summary:
Yes, **rs121913279** significantly influences drug metabolism and response, particularly for thiopurine drugs. Identifying this variant in patients is crucial for optimizing drug therapy and minimizing the risk of severe adverse effects.
