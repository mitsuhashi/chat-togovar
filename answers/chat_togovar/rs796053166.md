The data provided does not include information on allele frequencies specifically within Japanese populations for the variant rs796053166. The allele frequencies available are from the gnomAD dataset, which provides aggregated data across various populations but does not specify frequencies for Japanese individuals.

If further clarification or region-specific allele frequency data is required, it would need to be retrieved from datasets specifically covering Japanese populations, such as the ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization) or other related biobanks or genomic databases.
