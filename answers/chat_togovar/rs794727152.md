The rs794727152 variant has two known alternate alleles, G>A and G>C, both affecting the SCN2A gene. Below, I'll provide details specific to these alleles:

### 1. rs794727152 (G>A) Effect:
- **Gene and Transcript Information (1-1):**
  - **Gene:** SCN2A (Sodium channel, voltage-gated, type II alpha subunit)
  - **HGVS (G>A on Transcript ENST00000283256):**
    - **cDNA:** ENST00000283256.10:c.2558G>A
    - **Protein:** ENSP00000283256.6:p.Arg853Gln
    - **Genomic:** chr2:g.165342465G>A
  - Changes Arginine (Arg) to Glutamine (Gln) at position 853 in the protein sequence.

- **Predictions/Clinical Significance (1-2):**
  - **Disease Associations (ClinVar):**
    - Identified in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (C3150987).
    - Associated with complex neurodevelopmental disorders (C5568766).
    - Often classified as pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP).
  - **Functional Predictions:**
    - **SIFT:** Score = 0.0 → Predicted "deleterious."
    - **PolyPhen-2:** Score = 0.999 → Predicted "probably damaging."
    - **AlphaMissense:** Score = 0.9953 → High pathogenicity likelihood.
  - Likely disrupts the protein's ability to perform its function as a voltage-gated sodium channel, critical for neuronal signal transmission.

### 2. rs794727152 (G>C) Effect:
- **Gene and Transcript Information (1-1):**
  - **Gene:** SCN2A
  - **HGVS (G>C on Transcript ENST00000283256):**
    - **cDNA:** ENST00000283256.10:c.2558G>C
    - **Protein:** ENSP00000283256.6:p.Arg853Pro
    - **Genomic:** chr2:g.165342465G>C
  - Changes Arginine (Arg) to Proline (Pro) at position 853 in the protein sequence.

- **Predictions/Clinical Significance (1-2):**
  - **Disease Associations (ClinVar):**
    - Associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (C3150987) and benign familial infantile seizures (C1843140).
    - Classified as pathogenic (P).
  - **Functional Predictions:**
    - **SIFT:** Score = 0.0 → Predicted "deleterious."
    - **PolyPhen-2:** Score = 0.999 → Predicted "probably damaging."
    - **AlphaMissense:** Score = 0.9989 → High pathogenicity likelihood.
  - Introduction of proline is likely to significantly disrupt the local structure of the protein, impairing its functionality.

### Literature Evidence (1-3):
- Variants in SCN2A, including rs794727152, are frequently linked to epileptic encephalopathies and neurodevelopmental disorders. This particular residue (Arg853) is critical for the proper folding and function of the SCN2A protein, as disruptions here lead to severe functional deficits.

### Population Frequencies and Variation (1-4):
- No population frequency data is available for rs794727152 at present, which may indicate it is rare globally.

### GWAS and Functional Implications (1-5):
- GWAS data directly associating rs794727152 with other phenotypes are lacking, but it shows robust associations with epilepsy-related disorders.

### Summary:
The rs794727152 variant impacts the SCN2A gene in a potentially deleterious manner, particularly affecting the function of the sodium channel in neurons, which plays a critical role in maintaining electrical signaling. Both the G>A and G>C alleles are predicted to severely impact protein structure and contribute to neurodevelopmental and epileptic conditions.
