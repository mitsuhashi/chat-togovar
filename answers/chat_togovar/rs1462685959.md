### **Japanese Population Allele Frequencies**
1. **Source: ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**
   - Allele Frequency (AF): **0.00025599999935366213** (approximately 0.0256%)
   - Allele Count (AC): 22
   - Allele Number (AN): 85,808

2. **Source: JGA (Japanese Genome Variation Database)**
   - Allele Frequency (AF): **0.08620689809322357** (approximately 8.62%)
   - Allele Count (AC): 5
   - Allele Number (AN): 58

### Notes:
- The allele frequency varies slightly between the ToMMo and JGA databases due to differences in sample sizes and methodologies.
- For the JGA database, the allele frequency is quite high at 8.62%, but the sample size (AN = 58) is much smaller compared to ToMMo.
