# ChatTogoVar

The TogoVar API and available information do not provide a direct indication of whether the rs587782044 variant is dominant or recessive. However, rs587782044 affects the **CDH1 gene**, which is associated with diseases such as *Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer* (HDGC). Variants in the CDH1 gene are typically associated with an **autosomal dominant inheritance pattern** in the context of hereditary cancer-predisposing syndromes. This suggests that rs587782044 likely follows a dominant inheritance mode.

For further analysis, consulting specific family studies or additional literature focused on rs587782044 may be necessary.
