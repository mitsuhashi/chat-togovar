There is insufficient evidence or information provided in the TogoVar API data to specifically classify rs1489788269 as either a dominant or recessive variant. Determining whether a variant is dominant or recessive depends on its relationship to diseases and phenotypes, as well as the inheritance patterns seen in individuals or families who carry the variant.

In this case, the variant rs1489788269 is located in the **ALOXE3** gene, which has been implicated in **inborn genetic diseases**, according to ClinVar. However, without further clinical or familial data, the inheritance pattern cannot be definitively classified.
