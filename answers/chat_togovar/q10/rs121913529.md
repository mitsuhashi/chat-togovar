There is no direct information available from the TogoVar API or related databases explicitly specifying whether the rs121913529 variant is dominant or recessive. The interpretation of dominance or recessiveness depends on the specific disease or phenotype associated with the variant and the biological mechanism of the affected gene, **KRAS**.

However, the variant **rs121913529** in the KRAS gene is well known and linked to several **dominant, gain-of-function phenotypes** such as cancers (e.g., lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic carcinoma), based on its pathogenicity from **ClinVar**. Gain-of-function mutations in KRAS often confer dominant oncogenic properties.

If further clarification is needed, examining literature specific to KRAS role in related conditions might help pinpoint the inheritance pattern for precise phenotypes.
