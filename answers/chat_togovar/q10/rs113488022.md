The TogoVar API does not provide specific information on whether rs113488022 is associated with a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern. However, this variant is located in the **BRAF gene**, which is frequently implicated in certain cancers and disorders like **RASopathy** and **Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome**. These conditions often arise from **gain-of-function mutations** in the BRAF gene, and are generally associated with a **dominant inheritance pattern**.

To confirm the inheritance pattern for this specific variant, consultation with a genetics professional or additional functional studies is recommended. More information is available on the variant through [TogoVar rs113488022](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs113488022).
