# ChatTogoVar

Based on the information available for **rs121918719**, this variant is associated with **Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis 1 (ARCI1)**, which suggests that it follows an **autosomal recessive inheritance pattern**. This means that two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent) are typically necessary to manifest the condition.

### Supporting Information:
1. **ClinVar Significance**:
   - It is classified as "Pathogenic (P)" and "Likely Pathogenic (LP)" in relation to **autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis 1**, supporting its role in recessive inheritance. ([ClinVar: VCV000012481](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/12481))

2. **Gene Associated**:
   - The variant is located in the **TGM1 gene**, which encodes transglutaminase 1. Mutations in this gene are known to cause congenital ichthyosis when inherited in a recessive manner.

3. **Allele Frequency**:
   - This variant is rare in population databases, with an allele frequency of approximately **1.8 × 10⁻⁵** in Japanese individuals (ToMMo) and **1.57 × 10⁻⁵** in global populations (gnomAD exomes), consistent with a rare recessive disorder. The low overall frequency aligns with a recessive disease mechanism, as recessive traits are more commonly found in carriers rather than affected individuals.
