Based on the provided TogoVar API data, there is no direct information indicating whether rs12037987 is a dominant or recessive variant. Determining whether a variant is dominant or recessive depends on its functional effect on the gene/protein, the associated phenotype, and inheritance patterns usually determined through functional studies or clinical data. However, none of this information is included in the given dataset for rs12037987.

If you have further information about the specific disease context or inheritance data, that could help clarify its classification.
