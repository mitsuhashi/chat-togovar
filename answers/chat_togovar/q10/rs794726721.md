To determine whether rs794726721 is associated with a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern, we need to examine its relationship with diseases. Here is what the data suggests:

This variant (rs794726721) is linked with **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (SMEI)**, also known as **Dravet syndrome**, in the **SCN1A** gene. Dravet syndrome is commonly inherited in a **dominant** pattern, specifically an autosomal dominant one. This means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.
