Based on the information available from the TogoVar API and associated literature, **rs794727152** (a variant in the **SCN2A** gene) has been associated with several conditions such as **Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy, 11** and **West Syndrome**, which typically follow an **autosomal dominant inheritance pattern**. Variants in the SCN2A gene are often gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations, which can lead to neurological symptoms when only one copy of the gene (one allele) is affected. Consequently, **this variant is likely to exhibit a dominant effect**.

### Supporting Evidence:
- The **ClinVar database** describes the variant with interpretations such as "Pathogenic" (P) and "Likely Pathogenic" (LP), associated with autosomal dominant disorders (e.g., developmental and epileptic encephalopathy).
- Functional prediction tools (e.g., **PolyPhen = 0.999**, **SIFT = 0.0**, and **AlphaMissense = 0.9953**) indicate a damaging effect on protein function, consistent with dominant phenotypes in SCN2A-related disorders.
