There is currently no direct information from the TogoVar API or other available data sources regarding whether **rs1057519999** is a dominant or recessive variant. However, some traits or diseases associated with this variant may exhibit specific inheritance patterns that could help infer its dominance or recessiveness.

From the information retrieved via the TogoVar API:

1. **Gene**: The variant resides in the **TP53** gene, which is well-known for its crucial role in tumor suppression.
2. **Disease Associations**: This variant has been associated with **Li-Fraumeni syndrome**, a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome that is typically transmitted in an autosomal **dominant** manner. Additionally, several other malignancies (like breast neoplasms, small cell lung carcinoma, and large intestine neoplasms) have also been linked to mutations in the **TP53** gene.

Given this data, mutations in **TP53** are commonly associated with autosomal **dominant** inheritance patterns in many conditions. However, the exact dominance or recessiveness of a specific variant like **rs1057519999** may be context-dependent and might require further functional studies for confirmation.
