The inheritance pattern of rs571414497 cannot be determined solely from the data provided in the TogoVar API results. Information about whether the variant is dominant or recessive typically requires phenotypic correlation studies or analysis of its impact within specific genetic backgrounds.

For example, the variant information for rs571414497 suggests:
- It is a **missense variant** located in the **ALOXE3** gene.
- Functional effect predictions (SIFT: 1.0, benign; PolyPhen: 0.009, benign; AlphaMissense: 0.1493, predicted benign) suggest that its impact on the protein function is likely minimal.
- No explicit disease associations or clinical significance classifications are listed (ClinVar indicates "NC," No Clinical Significance).

This limited information doesn't provide evidence for whether the variant follows a dominant or recessive pattern. To clarify its inheritance pattern, studies on how the variant contributes to phenotypes or diseases would be necessary.
