There is no specific information available from the TogoVar data or other relevant sources regarding whether the **rs876660744** variant exhibits a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern. It is associated with conditions like **Hereditary diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma** and **Hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome**, but whether these manifestations are inherited dominantly or recessively depends on more detailed research, including family-based inheritance studies.

For hereditary diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma, mutations in the **CDH1** gene to which this variant belongs are typically known to follow an **autosomal dominant** inheritance pattern, although the relevance of this particular rsID needs further validation.
