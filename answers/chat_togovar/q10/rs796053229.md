The variant **rs796053229**, found in the **SCN8A** gene, is associated with several conditions that are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. According to the **ClinVar database**, this variant has been linked to diseases such as **developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, type 13** and **early infantile epileptic encephalopathy**. These conditions are often the result of **de novo dominant mutations** in the SCN8A gene, which encodes a sodium channel protein critical for neuronal function.

### Supporting Information:
- **Dominance of SCN8A mutations**: SCN8A-associated diseases are typically caused by gain-of-function mutations, which lead to hyperexcitability of neurons. These mutations manifest in a single allele (heterozygous state). Hence, individuals carrying a single pathogenic variant like rs796053229 can be affected.
- **Clinical Interpretation**: The variant has been classified as "Pathogenic" for several conditions by ClinVar, further supporting its role in dominant inheritance of these phenotypes.
