The information available regarding the dominant or recessive nature of the variant **rs796052984** is not explicitly stated in the provided data from the TogoVar API. However, based on the fact that the variant affects the **SCN1A** gene—known to be involved in conditions like **Dravet syndrome**, which often has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern—it is plausible that this variant may exhibit a dominant effect. However, further confirmation from additional studies or genetic context is required.

To explore more, you may visit the variant's page on **ClinVar** or **TogoVar** for specific details:

- ClinVar: [VCV000206786](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/206786)
- TogoVar: [tgv312799720](https://togovar.biosciencedbc.jp/variant/tgv312799720)

If you'd like a detailed inheritance analysis, I recommend consulting a geneticist or researching more through reliable literature sources.
