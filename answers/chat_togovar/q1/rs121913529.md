# ChatGPT Response

The TogoVar API output youâ€™ve shared does not provide specific allele frequency data for Japanese populations for variant `{rs}` (rs121913529). No allele frequency comparison specific to Japanese is available within this dataset. 

If additional external datasets such as gnomAD-Japanese or local genome studies were used for analysis, allele frequencies might be accessible. You can also try checking sources like the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD) or other region-specific genomic databases for more detailed population-specific data.
