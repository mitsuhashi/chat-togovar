The TogoVar API results do not include specific allele frequency data for Japanese populations for the variant with rsID **rs796053229**. The available frequency data comes from **gnomAD exomes**, where the allele frequency for the **G>A** variant is reported as **6.84131975958735e-07** (global population), but no Japanese-specific data is provided.

If further information is needed, it would be necessary to check specialized databases that focus on the Japanese population, such as the **Japanese Multi Omics Reference Panel (jMorp)**, but it is not included in the provided API results.
