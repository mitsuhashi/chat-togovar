The query does not provide specific information to calculate or directly answer the allele frequency question for Japanese populations using TogoVar data at this time. The data available from the TogoVar API result is for global allele frequencies from the gnomAD datasets, which are as follows:

1. **gnomAD Exomes**:
   - Allele Count (AC): 6
   - Allele Frequency (AF): 4.10433 × 10⁻⁶
   - Allele Number (AN): 1,461,870

2. **gnomAD Genomes**:
   - Allele Count (AC): 1
   - Allele Frequency (AF): 6.56970 × 10⁻⁶
   - Allele Number (AN): 152,214

Unfortunately, gnomAD does not currently separate allele frequencies for Japanese populations specifically. Further details might be available from population-specific databases, such as ToMMo (Japanese-specific) or other country-specific genomic datasets, but they are not included in this TogoVar API result.
