The provided TogoVar API output does not include allele frequency information specifically for Japanese populations or any subpopulation data. As a result, I cannot determine the allele frequency in Japanese populations for the variant with the specified rs number (`rs762927460`).

For more details, you can explore the variant's TogoVar page: [TogoVar rs762927460](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs762927460).

If further information from other databases is needed, let me know!
