The TogoVar API query results do not contain specific allele frequency information about the variant **rs796053216** in the Japanese population. The available information only includes global allele frequencies from sources like gnomAD but does not highlight specific data for Japanese or other subpopulations.

For a detailed investigation into allele frequencies specific to the Japanese population, further reference to region-specific datasets (e.g., the Japanese Multi-Omics Reference Panel) or databases like jMorp (https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/) may be required.
