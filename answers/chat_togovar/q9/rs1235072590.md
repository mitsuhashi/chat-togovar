To determine whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs1235072590** can be a target for genome editing using CRISPR-based methods, the following information is typically useful:

### 1-1. SNP Information
Unfortunately, based on the TogoVar API query provided in the instructions, there does not seem to be any available data for **rs1235072590**. Therefore, we lack specific information regarding its genetic details such as HGVS annotation, affected gene, or transcript.

### 1-2. Relationship With Diseases
Without additional data from external sources (e.g., ClinVar) or computational prediction scores (e.g., AlphaMissense, SIFT, PolyPhen), no conclusions can be drawn about whether this SNP is associated with specific diseases or has a functional impact that would make it a strong candidate for CRISPR genome editing.

### 1-3. Literature Evidence
There is no currently available literature or studies associated with this SNP (rs1235072590) based on the given query. This makes it challenging to assess whether it has been experimentally validated as a target or discussed in the context of genome editing.

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies
No allele frequency data is available to compare Japanese and non-Japanese populations for this variant, which might otherwise provide insights into population-specific significance and guide genome editing efforts.

### 1-5. GWAS and Phenotype Association
No genome-wide association study (GWAS) data or phenotype associations are currently linked to rs1235072590.

### 1-6. TogoVar Page
There is no specific TogoVar page for this SNP, as the query returned no results.

#### Conclusion:
As of now, there is insufficient information about rs1235072590 to determine whether it could or should be a target for genome editing using CRISPR. Additional exploratory research is required to ascertain its genomic location, relevance to gene function, any association with disease phenotypes, and functional consequences of modification.

If you have access to more specific datasets or additional context about why this SNP might be of interest, please provide those details, and I can help refine the analysis further!
