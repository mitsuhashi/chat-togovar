To determine whether rs12037987 can be a target for genome editing (e.g., CRISPR), several factors need to be evaluated, including its genomic position, functional implications, and design considerations for sgRNA. Below is the information based on the provided API data and considerations for genome editing:

---

### 1-1. **Variant Details**

- **rs Number**: rs12037987  
- **Gene Name**: WNT2B  
- **Transcript Names**:  
    - ENST00000256640.9  
    - ENST00000369686.9  
    - NM_001291880.1  
    - NM_004185.4  
- **HGVS Notation**:  
    - Genomic: `chr1:g.112500200T>C`  
    - Transcript: For example:
        - `ENST00000256640.9:c.-94-14674T>C`  
        - `NM_004185.4:c.125+9119T>C`
- **Position**: Chr1:112500200  

Given its precise location, this variant can theoretically be targeted by CRISPR using gRNA designed around the site.

### 1-2. **Functional Relevance to Diseases**

- **ClinVar Significance**: Classified as "NC" (Uncertain or No Clinical Significance).  
- **Predictors (SIFT, PolyPhen, AlphaMissense)**: No specific data available.  
- It is unknown whether this variant has functional consequences that could be targeted therapeutically.

---

### 1-3. **Relevant Literature**

No specific literature discussing the functional role of rs12037987 or its utility as a CRISPR target was identified in the provided data. Further search in the literature may be necessary.

---

### 1-4. **Allele Frequency by Population**

- **Japanese (JGA, ToMMo)**: Frequent, with an allele frequency of ~29.9%.  
- **Non-Japanese (gnomAD)**: Lower allele frequency of ~8.9%.

This significant difference in allele frequency may suggest population-specific relevance. Its frequent occurrence in the Japanese population makes it an interesting candidate for studies focused on that population.

---

### 1-5. **GWAS and Phenotype Associations**

No GWAS associations or related phenotypes are mentioned in the provided data. Thus, the functional impact remains uncertain.

### Considerations for CRISPR Targeting

To assess whether rs12037987 is a suitable CRISPR target, the following steps are necessary:

1. **Functional Validation**: Confirm whether this variant impacts WNT2B gene expression or function significantly.
2. **Guide RNA Design**: 
    - Design sgRNA around position Chr1:112500200.
    - Ensure off-target effects are minimized via computational tools like CRISPR-Cas9 design software (e.g., Benchling, CHOPCHOP).
3. **Population-Specific Targeting**: Given its higher allele frequency in the Japanese population, editing strategies may need to consider population-specific applications.

### Conclusion

Currently, no data directly supports the use of rs12037987 as a therapeutic CRISPR target. However, it is theoretically possible to design CRISPR constructs for this site. Functional studies are required to validate its biological significance and potential as a target.
