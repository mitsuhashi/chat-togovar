There is no specific information in the dataset or literature provided that directly indicates rs880315 as a target for genome editing via CRISPR. However, I can analyze the variant to infer its potential feasibility for genome editing based on the available data.

### Variant Summary (from the TogoVar API):
1. **rs Number**: rs880315
2. **Gene**: CASZ1 (Castor zinc finger 1)
3. **Transcript IDs**:
   - ENST00000344008.5:c.-77+23892A>G
   - ENST00000377022.8:c.-77+23892A>G
   - NM_001079843.3:c.-77+23892A>G
   - NM_017766.5:c.-77+23892A>G
4. **Genomic Location**: Chromosome 1: Position 10736809 (hgvs_g: chr1:g.10736809T>C)
5. **Most Severe Consequence**: The variation is categorized as a **SO_0001627 (intron_variant)**, meaning it occurs in a non-coding intronic region of CASZ1.

### Consideration for Genome Editing with CRISPR:
1. **Target in CASZ1 Gene**:
    - CASZ1 has functions related to transcriptional regulation, and its role in various processes like cardiac development has been studied. Depending on its functional role in disease, targeting intronic variants like rs880315 may indirectly modulate splicing or regulate downstream gene expression.
    
2. **Feasibility**:
    - Variants in non-coding regions may be less immediately impactful compared to coding variants, but some intronic variants can affect splicing enhancers or silencers. Functional studies would be necessary to confirm if rs880315 influences splicing or gene regulation in CASZ1 before determining a need for CRISPR targeting.

3. **Designing gRNA for CRISPR**:
    - The specific sequence around rs880315 (chr1:g.10736809T>C) would need to be assessed for PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) sequences such as NGG (for SpCas9) or TTN (for Cpf1), as these are critical for targeting with CRISPR-Cas systems.
    - Off-target effects must be evaluated, particularly since intronic regions may have high homology to other genomic regions.

4. **Clinical Applications**:
    - The lack of current disease associations for rs880315 in databases like ClinVar suggests no strong evidence of pathogenicity, making it less likely that this variant is a primary target for clinical or therapeutic genome editing.
    - If future research reveals a role in disease, rs880315 could be considered a target, but as of now, its potential applications are speculative.

### Conclusion:
While rs880315 in CASZ1 could theoretically be targeted for genome editing with properly designed CRISPR constructs, there is currently no evidence to suggest it as a critical pathogenic or functional variant requiring editing. Further research on its potential role in splicing, regulation, or disease association is needed to justify genome editing efforts.
