To determine whether **rs796052984** can be a target for genome editing (e.g., CRISPR), we need to assess the following factors:

### 1. Variant Information
#### **Basic Details**
- **rs Number**: [rs796052984](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs796052984)
- **Gene**: SCN1A (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 1)
- **Transcripts**:
  - ENST00000303395 (major transcript): c.2722G>C, p.Gly908Arg
  - ENST00000303395: c.2722G>A, p.Gly908Ser

#### **Key Functional Insights**
The SCN1A gene encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel critical for neuronal excitability, and its variants are associated with conditions such as epilepsy. Both the **C>G** and **C>T** allelic variants at this position affect critical residues.

### 2. Disease Association and Functional Consequence
From the TogoVar API results:
- **C>G** change has a ClinVar classification of "Likely Pathogenic (LP)".
- **C>T** change is reported as "Uncertain Significance (US)".

Both variants have strong predictions of damaging effects:
- **SIFT Score**: 0.0 (deleterious)
- **PolyPhen-2 Score**: 
  - C>G: 0.999 (probably damaging)
  - C>T: 0.998 (probably damaging)
- **AlphaMissense**: 
  - C>G: 0.9997 (strongly deleterious)
  - C>T: 0.9872 (deleterious)

This suggests that any editing targeting rs796052984 has the potential to correct or further disrupt the function of the SCN1A gene, which needs to be carefully considered in the context of therapeutic applications.

### 3. CRISPR Feasibility
Genome editing feasibility for this variant depends on:
- The sequence near rs796052984 falls within the SCN1A coding region, making it a feasible candidate for CRISPR-based intervention.
- The editing target sequence (20 bp target + adjacent PAM) must be determined. If a suitable PAM sequence (e.g., NGG for Cas9) exists close to rs796052984, CRISPR-based editing can be applied.
- Functional consequences of the edit must be studied, particularly in disease models (e.g., epilepsy).

### 4. Use in Therapeutics
This variant could theoretically be a target for CRISPR editing in diseases where SCN1A mutation leads to pathogenic phenotypes (e.g., Dravet syndrome, epilepsy), provided:
1. Delivery systems are optimized (e.g., viral vectors like AAVs).
2. Off-target activity is minimal.
3. Corrective edits donâ€™t adversely affect normal SCN1A function.

---

### Conclusion
Yes, **rs796052984** could technically be a target for genome editing, as it resides in the coding region of SCN1A with pathogenic implications. However, the practicality of targeting this site depends on nearby PAM sites, the specific disease context, and experimental validation.
