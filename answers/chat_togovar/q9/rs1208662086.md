There is no direct information in the provided data regarding rs1208662086 being a target for genome editing or CRISPR-related studies. However, I can provide relevant details from the available data to help assess its suitability as a target for genome editing.

### 1-1. Variant Information:
- **rs number**: [rs1208662086](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs1208662086)
- **HGVS**: Multiple HGVS annotations are available, including:
    - **Protein level**: `p.Ala2Ser` (affecting the SQSTM1 protein in several transcripts).
    - **Genomic level**: `chr5:g.179820940G>T`.
    - **Transcript level**: Examples include `ENST00000389805.9:c.4G>T`.
- **Gene**: **SQSTM1** (Sequestosome 1), known to play roles in cellular signaling and pathology.
- **Transcript**: Multiple transcripts (e.g., ENST00000389805, NM_003900.5).

### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases and Annotation Tools:
- Tools like **SIFT, Polyphen, and AlphaMissense** provide insights into the potential functional impact:
    - **SIFT**: Scores range from 0.05 to 0.08 across transcripts, suggesting a deleterious impact.
    - **Polyphen**: Scores range from 0.119 to 0.969, with some transcripts showing potentially damaging effects.
    - **AlphaMissense**: Value of `0.0947`, indicating a likely reduction in protein function.

No specific diseases are currently listed in the provided dataset's curated significance (ClinVar) under this variant.

### 1-3. Literature:
No literature links are provided in the dataset. Further research in scientific databases could reveal studies that investigate rs1208662086.

### 1-4. Allele Frequency:
- **gnomAD Exomes**: The allele frequency (AF) is 7.14 × 10⁻⁷.
- **gnomAD Genomes**: AF is 6.57 × 10⁻⁶.
Comparison with Japanese and non-Japanese populations was not provided but indicates extremely low global frequency.

### 1-5. GWAS Results:
No genome-wide association study (GWAS) results are available for this variant.

### 1-6. TogoVar Link:

### Suitability for Genome Editing:
Genome editing targeting rs1208662086 may be feasible if:
1. This variant is proven to have a significant functional or disease-related impact after further study.
2. The variant location (within the **SQSTM1 gene**) is accessible for CRISPR guides (considering local chromatin structure and off-targets).
3. The biological function of the **Ala2Ser** substitution, or other transcript variations, is validated as clinically relevant.

Further experimental validation and CRISPR guide design (tools like CRISPOR or Benchling) are necessary to confirm feasibility.
