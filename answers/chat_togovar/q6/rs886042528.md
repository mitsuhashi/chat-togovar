# ChatTogoVar

There is no direct information available from the TogoVar API or the provided dataset regarding the influence of rs886042528 on drug metabolism or response. The variant is associated with the **SCN1A** gene, which encodes a sodium channel subunit, and is primarily linked to neurological conditions such as **epileptic encephalopathies**. However, SCN1A variants in general have been studied for their potential role in drug response, particularly in epilepsy treatments (e.g., response to sodium channel blockers). 

For specific details on rs886042528 and its role in drug metabolism or response, further literature review or functional studies would be required.
