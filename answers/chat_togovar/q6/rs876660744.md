# ChatTogoVar

There is no explicit information available in the provided TogoVar API data or other curated sources (including ClinVar, predictions such as SIFT, PolyPhen, AlphaMissense, and allele frequencies) on whether rs876660744 directly influences drug metabolism or response.

However, **rs876660744** is a variant in the **CDH1** gene (encoding E-cadherin), which is primarily involved in cell-cell adhesion and widely associated with diseases like hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. This gene has no known primary role in pathways directly linked to drug metabolism. There is no mention of pharmacogenomics-related effects for this specific variant in databases like ClinVar or in the gnomAD population database.

For further information, additional functional studies or literature searches beyond the provided TogoVar data might be necessary.
