There is no explicit mention in the provided TogoVar data that rs1201448391 directly influences drug metabolism or response. 

- **Variant Information (rs1201448391)**:
  - Gene: ALOX12B (Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type)
  - Transcripts: Multiple (e.g., ENST00000647874, ENST00000649809) with predicted impacts on protein function.

While the ALOX12B gene is associated with lipid metabolism processes, there is no curated evidence linking this specific variant to drug metabolism or response in the retrieved data. As this variant is observed at a very low allele frequency in various populations, any potential involvement in drug metabolism would likely require detailed functional validation.

For further exploration, you may review broader literature sources or pharmacogenomic databases such as PharmGKB.
