Based on the information retrieved from the TogoVar API, there is no direct mention of rs794727152 influencing drug metabolism or response. The variant is primarily associated with **developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE)** and other neurodevelopmental disorders, as it occurs in the **SCN2A** gene, which encodes a sodium channel subunit critical for neuronal excitability.

### Key Points:
1. **Variant Identification**:
   - **rs number**: [rs794727152](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs794727152)
   - **Gene**: SCN2A
   - **HGVS Notation**: Multiple transcripts are affected, including:
     - **NM_001040142.2:c.2558G>A (p.Arg853Gln)**
     - **NM_001040142.2:c.2558G>C (p.Arg853Pro)**

2. **Disease Associations**:
   - The variant is linked to **developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, 11 (DEE11)** and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
   - It is classified as **pathogenic (P)** or **likely pathogenic (LP)** in ClinVar.

3. **Drug Metabolism or Response**:
   - No evidence from the TogoVar API or ClinVar suggests that rs794727152 directly influences drug metabolism or pharmacogenomic response.
   - However, **SCN2A variants** are known to affect neuronal sodium channels, which could theoretically influence the efficacy or side effects of drugs targeting these channels (e.g., anticonvulsants like sodium channel blockers). This is not explicitly mentioned for rs794727152.

4. **Predictive Models**:
   - The variant is predicted to be damaging by computational tools:
     - **SIFT**: 0.0 (deleterious)
     - **PolyPhen**: 0.999 (probably damaging)
     - **AlphaMissense**: 0.9953â€“0.9989 (high pathogenicity)

5. **Literature Evidence**:
   - No specific publications were retrieved linking rs794727152 to drug response.

6. **Population Frequency**:
   - No allele frequency data is available for this variant, suggesting it is rare.

### Conclusion:
While rs794727152 is not directly linked to drug metabolism or response, its location in the **SCN2A** gene suggests a potential indirect impact on the effectiveness of sodium channel-targeting drugs, such as anticonvulsants. Further pharmacogenomic studies would be required to confirm any such relationship.
