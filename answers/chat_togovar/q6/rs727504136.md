There is no direct information available from the TogoVar API or other sources in the provided data regarding the influence of rs727504136 on drug metabolism or response. The variant is associated with the **SCN1A** gene, which encodes a sodium channel subunit, and is primarily linked to neurological conditions such as epilepsy. However, SCN1A variants in general have been studied for their potential role in drug response, particularly in epilepsy treatment (e.g., response to antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin or carbamazepine). 

For this specific variant (rs727504136), no curated or predictive data explicitly connects it to drug metabolism or response.
