There is no information available from the TogoVar API or related tools indicating that the variant **rs727504136** specifically influences drug metabolism or response. This variant has, however, been implicated in severe neurological diseases, such as **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy**, and is located in the **SCN1A** gene, which encodes the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1.

The **SCN1A** gene itself is known to be involved in the pharmacogenomics of epilepsy drugs, particularly impacting response to antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin. Currently, no direct evidence links **rs727504136** specifically to altered drug response.

For detailed information, you can refer to the [ClinVar record for rs727504136](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/167639).

If you would like broader pharmacogenomic data for the entire **SCN1A** gene, please let me know!
