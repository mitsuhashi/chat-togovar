There is **no information available** directly linking rs704341 to drug metabolism or response from the TogoVar API results. Additionally, there is no evidence in the above data regarding an association with pharmacogenomics-related traits (e.g., drug metabolism or response). Below is a summary of information related to rs704341:

### 1-1. Variant Details:
- **rs Number:** [rs704341](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs704341)
- **Gene Name:** PTPRG (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Receptor Type G)
- **Transcript Names and HGVS Notation:**
  - ENST00000295874.14:c.191-26563G>A
  - ENST00000474889.6:c.191-26563G>A
  - NM_002841.4:c.191-26563G>A
  - Other transcript variations are available as listed in the TogoVar response.

### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases:
- This variant is classified as "NC" (no clinical significance) in the TogoVar dataset. No disease associations or functional predictions (e.g., SIFT, PolyPhen, or AlphaMissense) were found for this variant.

### 1-3. Literature Evidence:
- There is no specific literature evidence from the dataset provided linking rs704341 to drug metabolism, response, or pharmacogenomics-related studies.

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies:
- In Japanese populations (e.g., Tommo), the allele frequency for rs704341 is 0.0158 (1.58%).
- In non-Japanese populations (e.g., gnomAD Genomes), the allele frequency is higher at 0.1119 (11.19%).
- These differences suggest population-based variability that could potentially influence studies involving ethnicity-dependent traits, but no specific associations with drug response are reported.

### 1-5. GWAS and Phenotypes:
- No genome-wide association study (GWAS) results or phenotype indications related to rs704341 and drug response are available.
