The provided TogoVar API data does not include specific information about the influence of rs121913529 on drug metabolism or response. This variant is located in the **KRAS** gene and is associated with various cancers, such as non-small cell lung carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer, but no direct evidence linking it to drug metabolism or response is mentioned in the dataset.

If you are interested in the role of KRAS mutations in drug response, it is worth noting that KRAS mutations, including those at codon 12 (e.g., p.Gly12Val, p.Gly12Asp), are known to influence the efficacy of certain cancer therapies, such as EGFR inhibitors. However, this information is general and not specific to rs121913529.

For further details, you may consult pharmacogenomic databases like PharmGKB or literature specific to KRAS mutations and drug response.
