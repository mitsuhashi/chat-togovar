Based on the TogoVar API data provided, there is **no specific information** about rs121913279 directly influencing drug metabolism or response. The variant is associated with the **PIK3CA gene**, which is widely studied in cancer biology, particularly for its role in pathways like PI3K/AKT signaling. Variants in this gene, including rs121913279, are well-documented for their impacts on oncogenic processes and disease phenotypes, but its influence on pharmacogenomics (e.g., drug metabolism and response) is not highlighted in the dataset provided.

For additional details, external resources such as PharmGKB or more literature searches might provide insights if such associations exist.
