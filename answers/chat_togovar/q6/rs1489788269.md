# ChatTogoVar

There is no information from the TogoVar API or available sources that explicitly associates **rs1489788269** with drug metabolism or drug response. This variant appears to be connected mainly to inborn genetic diseases based on its classification in ClinVar, but no specific mention of its role in pharmacogenetics is provided. Further exploration in pharmacogenomics-specific databases or experimental studies would be necessary to clarify its role, if any, in drug metabolism.
