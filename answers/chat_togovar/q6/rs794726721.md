There is no direct information available from the TogoVar API or other sources in the provided data about rs794726721 influencing drug metabolism or response. The variant is associated with the **SCN1A** gene, which is primarily linked to neurological conditions such as **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (SMEI)**. However, SCN1A variants have been studied in the context of drug response, particularly to antiepileptic drugs like sodium channel blockers, but this specific variant (rs794726721) does not have curated evidence or literature explicitly linking it to drug metabolism or response.
