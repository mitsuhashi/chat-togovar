# ChatTogoVar

There is no information available from the TogoVar API or other referenced resources indicating that rs796053216 is directly related to drug metabolism or drug response. The variant is associated with the **SCN8A** gene and has been studied primarily in the context of neurological conditions, particularly epilepsy-related disorders like **developmental and epileptic encephalopathy** and **epileptic encephalopathy**. However, there is no literature linking this variant specifically to pharmacogenomic traits.

If further research findings exist, they would need to be checked in dedicated pharmacogenomics databases (e.g., PharmGKB) or relevant scientific literature.
