There is no evidence from the provided TogoVar API data to suggest that rs796053229 directly influences drug metabolism or response. The available data primarily associates rs796053229 with conditions such as **developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, complex neurodevelopmental disorder**, and **early infantile epileptic encephalopathy** based on ClinVar submissions, without mention of pharmacogenomic implications.

For further investigation, pharmacogenomics studies or additional resources like PharmGKB may need to be consulted.
