Let's address this variant, rs794726721, by checking its structure and functional impact:

---

### **1. Link Information (1-1)**
- **rs number**: rs794726721
- **Gene Name**: SCN1A, associated with voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1.
- **HGVS** (highlighting protein-level changes for different alleles):
  - For G > A substitution: Results in **p.Gln910Ter** in certain transcripts (stop-gain or nonsense mutation causing truncation of the protein).
  - For G > T substitution: Results in **p.Gln910Lys**, a missense mutation (amino acid substitution).
- **Transcript Names**:
  - Example: NM_001165963.4:c.2728C>T, NM_006920.6:c.2695C>A.

### **2. Disease Relationship (1-2)**
- **Curated Data**:
  - **Pathogenicity** (ClinVar):
    - G > A is classified as **Likely Pathogenic (LP)** for **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy** (SMEI), leading to truncated, likely non-functional proteins due to premature stop codons.
    - G > T is classified as **Pathogenic (P)** for SMEI. It disrupts gene function by substituting the large residue glutamine (Q) with lysine (K) in crucial protein domains.
  - **Functional Predictions**:
    - For G > T:
      - **AlphaMissense**: 0.9868 (high pathogenic potential).
      - **SIFT**: 0.0 (deleterious).
      - **Polyphen-2**: Up to 0.982 (probably damaging).
- **Protein Impact**:
  - Likely impacts the ion channel's ability to properly function, directly influencing neural excitability.

### **3. Literature Findings (1-3)**
No detailed information from the TogoVar API references any specific experimental results about structural disruption, but relevant functional studies highlight that **nonsense mutations in SCN1A** cause loss of function, while **missense mutations often disrupt channel gating**. Research on related variants has established their involvement in epileptogenic syndromes.

### **4. Allele Frequencies (1-4)**
- **Reported frequency (G > A)**: 
  - Global allele frequency (~4.2e-05 in the NCBI dataset). Not detected in Japanese-specific datasets per TogoVar.
  - **Population Insight**: Rare variant with comparable frequencies globally due to its pathogenic and highly deleterious nature.
- **G > T** frequency: Not provided, potentially because of rarity in databases.

---

### **5. GWAS and Phenotype Association (1-5)**
- **Phenotype**:
  - Both G > A and G > T substitutions are associated with **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy** (SMEI), characterized by epilepsy onset in the first year.
  - Related GWAS on SCN1A variants often implicate neurological conditions related to sodium channel dysfunction.

### **Summary**
The rs794726721 variant impacts the **SCN1A** gene profoundly:
1. **G > A** triggers stop-gain mutations, leading to truncated and likely non-functional proteins compromising ion channel activity.
2. **G > T** substitutes a functional residue, altering sodium channel gating and neuronal signal propagation. Both are linked to severe neurological disease (**SMEI**).
