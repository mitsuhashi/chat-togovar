- **Transcript Names**:
  - SCN1A (several transcript variants with different nomenclatures, e.g., ENST00000303395, NM_006920.6)

### 2. Clinical Significance and Predictions (1-2)
- **C>G Variant (p.Gly908Arg)**:
  - Predicted as **damaging**:
    - SIFT: 0.0 (deleterious)
    - PolyPhen: 0.999 (probably damaging)
    - AlphaMissense: 0.9997 (high pathogenicity likelihood)
  - ClinVar Interpretation: Likely pathogenic (LP) with 1 submission. Condition marked as "not provided."
- **C>T Variant (p.Gly908Ser)**:
  - Predicted as **damaging**:
    - SIFT: 0.0 (deleterious)
    - PolyPhen: 0.998 (probably damaging)
    - AlphaMissense: 0.9872 (high pathogenicity likelihood)
  - ClinVar Interpretation: Uncertain significance (US) for conditions such as:
    - **Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy with Suppression Bursts**
    - Other inborn genetic diseases

### 3. Literature (1-3)
No specific records of articles or studies linked directly to rs796052984 appear in the TogoVar API results.

### 4. Allele Frequency (1-4)
- C>T variant (p.Gly908Ser):
  - **gnomAD Exomes**: Allele frequency = 7.52 × 10⁻⁶ (11/1461880)
  - **Japanese Data (NCBN)**: Allele frequency = 4.25 × 10⁻⁵ (1/23538)
- C>G variant (p.Gly908Arg): No specific allele frequency reported.
- **Observation**: These variants are rare in the global population, including Japanese individuals, potentially supporting their pathogenicity in specific cases.

### 5. GWAS Association (1-5)
No GWAS-reported associations for rs796052984 appear in TogoVar.

### 6. TogoVar Link (1-6)

### Phenotypic Association:
- **SCN1A Gene**: Mutations in the SCN1A gene can lead to a wide range of neurological disorders, including epileptic encephalopathies (e.g., Dravet syndrome).
- The **C>G variant (p.Gly908Arg)** is classified as likely pathogenic and might lead to significant alterations in the sodium channel protein Nav1.1, impacting neurological functioning and possibly leading to seizure disorders.
- The **C>T variant (p.Gly908Ser)** has uncertain significance but is still predicted to be damaging. The phenotype spectrum may overlap with epileptic conditions such as those seen with other SCN1A mutations.

### Conclusion:
The location (SCN1A, exon region) strongly influences the clinical phenotype, particularly regarding epilepsy-related disorders. ClinVar classification suggests variable effects ranging from uncertain significance to likely pathogenic. Further functional studies would solidify the understanding of these variants.
