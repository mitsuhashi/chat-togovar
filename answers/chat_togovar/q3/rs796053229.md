### Clinical Phenotype Influence
The rs796053229 variants directly impact the **SCN8A** gene, which is crucial for sodium channel function in neurons. Both G>A and G>T substitutions affect arginine residues at critical positions within the SCN8A protein (e.g., Arg1872 or Arg1831), leading to altered ion channel functionality. These disruptions contribute to severe disorders such as **epileptic encephalopathy** and **neurodevelopmental delays**, characterized by seizures, cognitive impairment, and developmental challenges. Predictive tools (SIFT, PolyPhen, AlphaMissense) consistently indicate a damaging effect.
