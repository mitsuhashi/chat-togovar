#### 1-2. **Relationship with clinical phenotypes**  
The variant rs745774658 is classified with significance interpretations based on disease associations:  
1. **G>A**:
   - **ClinVar significance**: Associated with "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, 11" (**MedGen: C3150987**) and "Seizures, benign familial infantile, 3" (**MedGen: C1843140**) with a *Uncertain Significance (US)* rating.  
   - **Prediction models**:
     - **SIFT**: 0.03 (deleterious)
     - **PolyPhen**: 0.112 (benign to possibly damaging)  
     - **AlphaMissense**: 0.0833 (low pathogenic probability)  

2. **G>T**:
   - **ClinVar significance**: Associated with "Seizure" (**MedGen: C0036572**) and classified as *Likely Benign (LB)*.  
   - **Prediction models**:
     - **SIFT**: 0.02 (deleterious)

#### 1-3. **Literature evidence**  
No specific references to rs745774658's clinical impact are detailed in TogoVar API. Further manual literature checks may be needed.  

#### 1-4. **Allele frequency comparison**  
The allele frequencies show notable population differences:  
1. **G>A**:
   - Japanese (ToMMo database): 0.00010 (10 per 100,000 alleles)
   - Non-Japanese (gnomAD exomes/genomes): 0.000017 (1.7 per 100,000 alleles)  

2. **G>T**:
   - Only observed in non-Japanese populations:  
     - gnomAD exomes: 0.0000061 (0.6 per 100,000 alleles).  

The higher allele frequency of G>A in Japanese populations suggests possible ethnicity-related variability for this change.

### Summary  
The location of **rs745774658**, specifically in the SCN2A gene, modulates risk for neurological phenotypes like **developmental epileptic encephalopathy** and **benign familial infantile seizures**. However, the clinical impact varies based on the substitution type (*G>A* vs *G>T*). Predictions from tools like SIFT and PolyPhen provide conflicting evidence, and allele frequency differences between Japanese and non-Japanese populations imply ethnicity-dependent effects. Further experimental evidence is required to clarify phenotypic relationships.
