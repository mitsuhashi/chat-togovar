### 1-4. **Allele Frequencies Across Populations**
- **Japanese Populations**: 
  - GEM Japan WGA: Frequency = 0.0160
  - ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank): Frequency = 0.0158
- **Non-Japanese Populations**:  
  - gnomAD Genomes: Frequency = 0.1119
- Explanation: This variant is notably rarer in Japanese populations (~1.5-1.6%) compared to global (non-Japanese) sources (~11.2%). This is likely due to population-specific genetic diversity patterns.

### Summary:
While rs704341 is a variant located in the *PTPRG* gene, there is currently no strong evidence associating it with specific clinical phenotypes or diseases. It exhibits notable differences in allele frequencies between Japanese and non-Japanese populations, indicating a potential role in population genetics. However, more functional or population studies are needed to determine its biological or clinical relevance.
