### Information about rs794726784:

#### **1-1. Basic variant details:**
- **rs number**: rs794726784  
- **HGVS**: Multiple transcript-specific representations provided, e.g.,:
  - **ENST00000303395.9**: `c.4223G>A` or `p.Trp1408Ter`
  - **NM_001165963.4**: `c.4223G>A` or `p.Trp1408Ter`
- **Gene name**: **SCN1A**  
  - SCN1A encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.1), essential for neuronal action potentials.
- **Transcript name**: Multiple associated transcripts, such as ENST00000303395.9 and NM_001165963.4.

#### **1-2. Relationship with diseases:**
This variant in the **SCN1A** gene is a **pathogenic nonsense mutation** resulting in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated or non-functional protein.

- **ClinVar Significance**: Pathogenic (**P**)  
- **Associated Diseases**:  
  1. Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (**SMEI**, MedGen C0751122)  
  2. Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 2 (**GEFSP2**, MedGen C1858673)  

Both conditions are characterized by epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. SCN1A mutations disrupt sodium channel function in neurons critical for maintaining electrical signaling.

- **No prediction tools results** (SIFT, PolyPhen, AlphaMissense) are available for this specific variant, but the nature of nonsense mutations (e.g., premature stop codons resulting in a truncated protein) supports its deleterious impact.

#### **1-3. Literature evidence:**
This variant has been reported in the context of multiple clinical studies that highlight its strong association with severe forms of epilepsy, such as Dravet Syndrome. Several research articles discuss the clinical manifestations of **SCN1A-related disorders**. For a comprehensive list of publications, refer to the links provided in the external resources section (ClinVar or PubMed).

#### **1-4. Allele Frequencies:**
- No population frequency data for rs794726784 is available either for Japanese or other populations. This is likely because this variant is rare and primarily arises in clinical cases with disease associations.

#### **1-5. GWAS associations:**
No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) link this variant to a broader phenotype other than its known association with epilepsy syndromes.

---

### Conclusion:
The **location of rs794726784 in the SCN1A gene** directly affects the clinical phenotype by introducing a **premature stop codon**, which truncates the voltage-gated sodium channel protein. The result is a non-functional protein that impairs electrical signaling in neurons, leading to severe epileptic syndromes like **Dravet syndrome and GEFSP2**.
