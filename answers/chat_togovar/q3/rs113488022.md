#### **1-2. Relationship With Clinical Phenotypes (ClinVar/Predictive Models):**
This variant in BRAF is notable for being located at **chromosome 7: 140,753,336 (GRCh38)**, specifically affecting codons such as **Valine-600 (V600)** in the serine/threonine kinase domain of the BRAF protein. This domain is critical for its kinase activity and downstream signaling in the MAPK/ERK pathway.

- **ClinVar Classifications:**  
  - **Pathogenic (P):**  
    - Melanoma, RASopathies, colon cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, astrocytoma, and lung adenocarcinoma.  
  - **Likely Pathogenic (LP):**  
    - Multiple myeloma, glioblastoma, colonic neoplasm, lung carcinoma.  

- **Functional Prediction of Impacts:**  
  - **AlphaMissense:** Very high pathogenicity (V600E substitution has a score of 0.9927).  
  - **SIFT Score:** 0.0 (Damaging prediction for functional disruption).  
  - **PolyPhen-2 Score:** Ranges from 0.482–0.958 (Probably damaging, especially for V600E).

#### **1-3. Literature Supporting Clinical Impacts:**
- Variants like **V600E** are among the most common somatic mutations in cancers:
  - Present in up to **60% of melanomas**.
  - Frequently identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and glioblastoma.
- V600E variant results in **constitutive activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway**, driving uncontrolled cell proliferation. Targeted therapies such as **BRAF inhibitors** (e.g., vemurafenib) have been developed to block these effects.
  
Examples of literature for V600E in BRAF:
