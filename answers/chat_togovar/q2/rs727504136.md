Here is the available information about rs727504136 and its influence on the clinical phenotype.

### 1. Variant Information (1-1):
- **RS Number**: rs727504136 [(dbSNP link)](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs727504136)
- **Gene Name**: **SCN1A** (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 1)
- Location: Chromosome 2, position 166012255
- Effect: This variant is a nucleotide change from **G to A**.
- **HGVS**:
  - Genomic: `chr2:g.166012255G>A`
  - Transcript (reference example): `ENST00000303395.9:c.3733C>T`
  - Protein: `ENSP00000303540.4:p.Arg1245Ter` (premature stop codon)

This variant introduces a stop codon in the SCN1A gene, leading to **truncation of the sodium channel protein**.

### 2. Relationship with Diseases (1-2):
- **Diseases Associated (ClinVar)**:
  - **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (SMEI)** [Dravet syndrome]
  - **Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 6B**
  - **Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 2**
  - **Migraine, Familial Hemiplegic 3**
  - **Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy with Suppression Bursts**
  - **Inborn Genetic Diseases**
- **Clinical Significance**: Classified as **Pathogenic (P)** in ClinVar [(ClinVar link)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/167639).

This premature truncation is expected to result in a loss-of-function of SCN1A, which is known to cause various epilepsy syndromes, especially those with early onset and treatment-resistant seizures.

---

### 3. Literature Evidence (1-3):
SCN1A loss-of-function mutations, including rs727504136, are extensively studied in the context of Dravet syndrome and related phenotypes. Variants that disrupt SCN1A function contribute to hyperexcitability in neuronal cells, linking them to treatment-resistant epilepsies. However, there is no specific literature reference retrieved for this particular variant.

---

### 4. Population Allele Frequency (1-4):
The variant rs727504136 has **no allele frequency data reported** in publicly available global databases (e.g., 1000 Genomes or gnomAD), indicating it is a **rare pathogenic mutation**.

---

### 5. GWAS Results (1-5):
There are no genome-wide association studies (GWAS) linking rs727504136 specifically to other phenotypes or traits beyond epilepsy.

---

### Clinical Implications:
The **location in the SCN1A gene** and its **pathogenicity classification** indicate that rs727504136 significantly impacts clinical phenotypes associated with **early-onset epilepsy (Dravet syndrome, etc.)** and potentially other neurodevelopmental disorders. Because SCN1A encodes a critical sodium channel for neuronal activity, its truncation likely results in disruption of neuronal signaling, which manifests as the severe phenotypic outcomes seen in associated diseases.
