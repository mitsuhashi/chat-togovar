- **rs number**: [rs1201448391](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs1201448391)
- **Gene name**: ALOX12B (Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type)
- **Transcript names and HGVS notations**:
  - **Variant C>A**:
    - Transcript: ENST00000647874.1
    - HGVS_c: `ENST00000647874.1:c.1654G>T`
    - HGVS_p: `ENSP00000497784.1:p.Gly552Cys`
  - **Variant C>G**:
    - Transcript: ENST00000647874.1
    - HGVS_c: `ENST00000647874.1:c.1654G>C`
    - HGVS_p: `ENSP00000497784.1:p.Gly552Arg`

#### 1-2. **Relationship with Diseases and Functional Predictions**
Both alleles have different amino acid substitutions predicted to affect protein function:
- **Variant C>A (p.Gly552Cys)**:
  - **SIFT**: 0.01 (Deleterious)
  - **PolyPhen-2**: 1.0 (Probably damaging)
  - **AlphaMissense**: 0.4615 (Uncertain)
- **Variant C>G (p.Gly552Arg)**:
  - **SIFT**: 0.0 (Deleterious)
  - **PolyPhen-2**: 1.0 (Probably damaging)
  - **AlphaMissense**: 0.46 (Uncertain)

> **Interpretation**: Both variants are predicted to disrupt the function of the ALOX12B protein, which is a 12-lipoxygenase involved in lipid metabolism and may play a role in epidermal differentiation.

#### 1-3. **Literature Evidence**
There is no specific literature on PubMed or other databases concerning the biochemical or structural effects of rs1201448391. Thus, there is no direct evidence linking the variant to functional studies.

### Conclusion:
The rs1201448391 variant impacts the ALOX12B gene, causing amino acid substitutions (p.Gly552Cys or p.Gly552Arg), which are predicted to be deleterious and damaging to protein structure and function. However, the variant is extremely rare, and no direct links to diseases or phenotypes have been established.
