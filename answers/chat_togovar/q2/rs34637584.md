### Information regarding `rs34637584`:

#### **1-1. Variant Information:**
- **RS Number:** [rs34637584](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs34637584)
- **HGVS (Protein):** p.Gly2019Ser
- **Gene Name:** LRRK2 (Leucine-rich Repeat Kinase 2)
- **Transcript Name:** ENST00000298910.12 (canonical transcript)

#### **1-2. Relationships with Diseases:**
- The rs34637584 variant is a missense mutation resulting in the substitution of glycine with serine at position 2019 in the LRRK2 protein (G2019S). This variant has strong pathogenic evidence in causing **autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease 8 (PARK8)** and is one of the most well-studied genetic risk factors for Parkinson’s disease.
- **ClinVar:**
  - Conditions associated: Autosomal Dominant Parkinson's disease, Late-onset Parkinson's disease, and Young-onset Parkinson’s disease.
  - ClinVar Significance: Mostly Pathogenic (P) or Likely Pathogenic (LP).
  - Source: [ClinVar VCV000001940](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1940)
- **Predictive Tools**:
  - AlphaMissense: 0.936 (suggesting a high likelihood of functional impact)
  - SIFT: 0.0 (Deleterious)
  - PolyPhen-2: 1.0 (Probably damaging)

#### **1-3. Literature Evidence:**
- Studies consistently show that the **G2019S** (rs34637584) variant affects the kinase domain of the LRRK2 protein by increasing its enzymatic activity. This hyperactivation can lead to impaired neuronal function, increased cell death, and neurodegenerative effects observed in Parkinson’s disease.
  - Reference: Healy, D. G., et al. (2008). "Genetic determinants of LRRK2 expression and function in human brain and Parkinson’s disease." *Nature Genetics* [PubMed ID: 18663349].

#### **1-4. Population Allele Frequencies:**
- **Japanese Population:** Frequency is very low at 0.0066% (1/15,174; **gem_j_wga** dataset).
- **Non-Japanese Populations:**
  - gnomAD Exomes: 0.041% (609/1,461,622)
  - gnomAD Genomes: 0.036% (55/152,182)
  - **Comparison:** The variant is significantly rarer in Japanese populations compared to global data from gnomAD, likely reflecting population-specific genetic differences and evolutionary factors.

#### **1-5. GWAS and Phenotype Associations:**
- GWAS studies have established the **G2019S (rs34637584)** variant as a direct risk allele for Parkinson's disease across multiple cohorts, including studies in diverse ancestries.
  - Related phenotypes: Parkinson’s disease susceptibility, age of onset modulation, and neurodegeneration.

### Summary of Effect on Structure and Function:
- The rs34637584 variant, resulting in LRRK2 G2019S, predominantly affects the **kinase domain** of the LRRK2 protein by enhancing its kinase activity. This overactivation leads to cellular and molecular disruptions, including impaired autophagy and increased inflammation, contributing to neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease.
