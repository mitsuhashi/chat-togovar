The variant rs121913529 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the **KRAS** gene on chromosome **12**. This SNP is associated with multiple alternate alleles (C>A, C>G, C>T) and has been studied extensively for its role in altering the function of the KRAS gene, which encodes a small GTPase protein involved in cell signaling pathways related to growth and differentiation. Below is a detailed interpretation regarding its structural and functional impacts:

### 1-2: **Relationship with Diseases and Pathogenicity Predictions**
   - **ClinVar Interpretation**:  
     Several interpretations for the variant alleles of rs121913529 indicate associations with various cancers (e.g., non-small cell lung carcinoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer). The variants are typically classified as **Pathogenic (P)** or **Likely Pathogenic (LP)**.
   - **Prediction Tools**:
     - **AlphaMissense**: Variant effects are predicted as deleterious, with scores such as 0.9949 (Gly12Val), 0.9575 (Gly12Ala), and 0.9984 (Gly12Asp), suggesting strong functional impacts.
     - **SIFT**: Predictions range from “Damaging” to “Tolerated,” with scores like 0.0 (Gly12Val and Gly12Asp).
     - **PolyPhen-2**: PolyPhen scores vary, with 0.985 (Gly12Val, probably damaging) and 0.653 (Gly12Asp, possibly damaging).

### 1-3: **Literature Evidence**
The rs121913529 variant is frequently reported in association with oncogenic activity:
   - Gly12-specific substitutions (e.g., Gly12Val, Gly12Asp) are found in many cancer types, including colorectal and lung cancers. These substitutions hinder GTPase activity, leading to uncontrolled signal transduction via the RAS pathway.  
   - KRAS mutations targeting codon 12 are common driver mutations in tumorigenesis (PMID: 17220226).

### 1-4: **Allele Frequencies**
   - **Japanese vs. Non-Japanese Populations**:  
     - GnomAD data shows a low allele frequency for these variants globally, with the frequencies ranging approximately:
       - Gly12Asp (C>T): 2.7387e-06 (gnomAD Exomes)  
       - Gly12Val (C>A): 6.8467e-07 (gnomAD Exomes)  
     No specific frequencies focused on Japanese populations are mentioned in the available datasets.

### 1-5: **Associated Phenotypes (GWAS)**
   - Known correlations from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or ClinVar are primarily related to:
     - **Cancer Phenotypes**: Non-small cell lung carcinoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and others.
     - Other phenotypes in ClinVar records include cerebral arteriovenous malformations and RASopathy syndromes.

### Structural and Functional Impacts
- **Structural Impact**:
  - The SNP often causes amino acid changes in the KRAS protein at position 12 (e.g., Gly12→Val, Gly12→Asp), affecting the protein's GTP-binding domain.
  - Alterations in this domain lock the KRAS protein in an active GTP-bound state, constitutively activating downstream signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK/ERK pathway).

- **Functional Impact**:
  - KRAS variants compromise the intrinsic GTPase activity, preventing proper hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, and result in continuous activation of growth-promoting signals.
  - This leads to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, a hallmark of cancer.
