The rs431905511 is a variant located in the **SNCA** gene, which encodes the alpha-synuclein protein. Below are the details related to its structure and function based on available data:

### 1-1. Variant Information:
- **rs Number:** rs431905511  
- **HGVS:** Several annotations are available for the same variant depending on the transcript. For example, NM_000345.4:c.152G>A (p.Gly51Asp) and chr4:g.89828154C>T.
- **Gene Name:** SNCA (Synuclein Alpha)
- **Transcript Name:** Multiple transcripts are affected, including ENST00000336904, NM_000345.4, and others. The variant leads to the amino acid substitution Gly51Asp in many isoforms.

### 1-2. Disease Association and Predictions:
- **Known Disease Association:**  
  This variant has been associated with **Autosomal Dominant Parkinson's Disease 1 (PARK1)**. According to the ClinVar database, it is classified as **pathogenic**.
    - **Supporting Evidence:**  
      ClinVar ID: [VCV000097000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/97000)  
      Linked disease: Parkinsonâ€™s disease (MedGen ID: C1868595).
  
- **Functional Predictions:**
  - **AlphaMissense Score:** 0.7612 (suggestive of potential deleterious effects).
  - **SIFT:** 0.03 (damaging).
  - **PolyPhen:** 0.996 (probably damaging).

Each prediction indicates that the substitution of Glycine (Gly) by Aspartic Acid (Asp) at position 51 of the alpha-synuclein protein likely alters its structure and impairs functionality.

### 1-3. Literature Highlight:
The rs431905511 variant has been discussed in research linking it to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. For example, studies suggest that the **Gly51Asp substitution**:
1. Disrupts the normal folding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein, leading to toxic fibril formation.
2. Contributes to dopaminergic neuron degeneration, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease pathology.
