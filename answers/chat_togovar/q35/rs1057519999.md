### Analysis of rs1057519999: Dominant or Recessive Variant?

The variant **rs1057519999** is located in the **TP53 gene**, which is a well-known tumor suppressor gene. Based on the information retrieved from the TogoVar API and additional knowledge, here is the analysis:

---

### 1. **Variant Identification**
- **rs Number**: [rs1057519999](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs1057519999)
- **Gene**: TP53
- **HGVS Notations**:
  - Example: `NM_000546.6:c.716A>T` (p.Asn239Ile)
- **TogoVar Link**: [TogoVar rs1057519999](https://togovar.org/variant/rs1057519999)

---

### 2. **Disease Associations**
The variant is associated with several conditions, including:
- **Li-Fraumeni syndrome**: A hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome caused by mutations in TP53. This syndrome is inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner.
- **Various cancers**: Including breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and others.

The **autosomal dominant inheritance** of Li-Fraumeni syndrome strongly suggests that pathogenic variants in TP53, including rs1057519999, are likely to act in a **dominant manner**.

---

### 3. **Literature Evidence**
- Variants in TP53, including those associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are well-documented in the literature as being **dominant**. However, no specific publications for rs1057519999 were retrieved from the TogoVar API.

---

### 4. **Allele Frequency Comparison**
- The allele frequencies for rs1057519999 are extremely low in global populations, indicating it is a rare variant. This rarity is consistent with its association with severe hereditary conditions like Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

---

### 5. **GWAS Findings**
No specific GWAS findings were retrieved for rs1057519999.

---

### Conclusion
Based on the association of rs1057519999 with **Li-Fraumeni syndrome**, which is inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner, this variant is most likely **dominant**.

---

### 日本語での説明
**rs1057519999**は、**TP53遺伝子**に位置する変異であり、Li-Fraumeni症候群などの疾患と関連しています。この症候群は**常染色体優性（autosomal dominant）**で遺伝するため、この変異も**優性（dominant）**である可能性が高いです。

- **関連疾患**: Li-Fraumeni症候群、乳がん、肺腺がんなど
- **結論**: rs1057519999は**優性変異**と考えられます。
