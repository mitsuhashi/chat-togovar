### 1. **Variant Identification**
- **rs Number**: [rs1208662086](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs1208662086)
- **Gene**: SQSTM1 (also known as p62)
- **Chromosomal Location**: Chromosome 5, position 179820940
- **HGVS Notations**:
  - Genomic: `chr5:g.179820940G>T`
  - Transcript (ENST00000389805): `c.4G>T`
  - Protein: `p.Ala2Ser`

### 2. **Disease Associations**
- **Predictive Models**:
  - **SIFT**: 0.05 (deleterious)
  - **PolyPhen-2**: 0.969 (probably damaging)
  - **AlphaMissense**: 0.0947 (low pathogenicity)
- **Clinical Significance**: No clinical significance has been reported in ClinVar for this variant. It is currently classified as "Not Classified (NC)."

**Comparison**: Other variants in the SQSTM1 gene, such as **p.Pro392Leu**, are well-documented and associated with diseases like Paget's disease of bone and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In contrast, rs1208662086 has no confirmed disease association yet.

---

### 3. **Literature Evidence**
No specific publications were found mentioning rs1208662086. However, the SQSTM1 gene is extensively studied for its role in neurodegenerative diseases and bone disorders.

**Comparison**: Variants like **p.Pro392Leu** have been widely studied in the context of Paget's disease, with multiple publications supporting their pathogenicity.

### 4. **Allele Frequency Comparison**
- **Global Frequency**:
  - gnomAD Exomes: 7.14 × 10⁻⁷
  - gnomAD Genomes: 6.57 × 10⁻⁶
- **Population-Specific Data**: No specific allele frequency data for Japanese or other populations is available for this variant.

**Comparison**: Pathogenic variants in SQSTM1, such as **p.Pro392Leu**, often have higher allele frequencies in specific populations (e.g., European populations for Paget's disease). In contrast, rs1208662086 is extremely rare globally.

---

### 5. **GWAS Findings**
No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked rs1208662086 to any phenotype.

**Comparison**: Other variants in SQSTM1 have been implicated in GWAS studies for bone density and neurodegenerative phenotypes.
