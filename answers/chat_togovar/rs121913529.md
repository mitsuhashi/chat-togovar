No specific information on the allele frequency of rs121913529 in Japanese populations is provided in the available TogoVar data. The allele frequency in broader populations (e.g., gnomAD) is available but does not separate data specifically for Japanese populations.

For broader gnomAD data:  
- **Alternate Alleles and Frequencies:**  
  - **C>A (12-25245350-C-A):** AF = 6.85e-07 (exomes only)  
  - **C>G (12-25245350-C-G):** AF = 1.37e-06 (exomes only)  
  - **C>T (12-25245350-C-T):** AF = 2.74e-06 (exomes), AF = 1.31e-05 (genomes)

For detailed Japanese-specific allele frequency data, you would need to consult a database that provides population-specific allele frequencies, such as the Japanese Genome Variation Database (JGVD) or an alternative focused resource.
