The location of rs121913529 at chromosome 12:25245350 corresponds to a series of well-documented **missense variants** in the **KRAS** gene that likely influence clinical phenotypes significantly. Below is the curated information:

---

### 1-1. Variant Details:
- **rs number**: rs121913529  
- **Gene**: **KRAS**  
- **HGVS (Representative Variations)**:
  - c.35G>T resulting in p.Gly12Val (G12V)
  - c.35G>C resulting in p.Gly12Ala (G12A)
  - c.35G>A resulting in p.Gly12Asp (G12D)
- **Transcript IDs** (selection): ENST00000256078, ENST00000311936, NM_004985.5

### 1-2. Disease Relationships:
The KRAS missense mutations at this locus are pathogenic and associated with a wide range of cancers and syndromes:
- **ClinVar Interpretations**:
  - **Pathogenic (P)**: Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, etc.
  - **Likely Pathogenic (LP)**: Acute myeloid leukemia, lung cancer.
  - **Uncertain Significance (US)**: Some rare cancers like Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
- **Functional Predictions**:
  - **SIFT**: Scores range from 0.0 to 0.14 (indicating deleterious effects).
  - **PolyPhen**: Values as high as 0.985 (probably damaging).
  - **AlphaMissense**: 0.9949–0.9984 (high pathogenic potential).

The variants specifically alter glycine at position 12 within the KRAS protein, leading to constitutive activation of its GTP-binding function and uninterrupted signaling through the RAS/MAPK pathway — a key driver of cell proliferation in cancers.

### 1-3. Literature Evidence:
Variants at this locus (including G12V, G12A, and G12D) consistently feature in studies identifying recurrent KRAS mutations in solid tumors:
- Found in adenocarcinomas of the **lung**, **pancreas**, **colorectal tissue**, and more.
- The KRAS G12 mutations often confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab, influencing treatment strategies in colorectal cancer.

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies:
- Across **global populations**:
  - G12 mutations (e.g., C>T for G12D) are rare (allele frequencies ~1.314e-05 to 2.738e-06, per gnomAD).  
- **Japanese vs. non-Japanese populations** comparison: Specific population studies were not referenced in the TogoVar dataset; no evidence suggests population-specific variant prevalence.

### 1-5. GWAS Phenotype Associations:
This variant has not been directly associated with any GWAS findings, but its functional outcomes link it to phenotypes like:
- Susceptibility to gastrointestinal cancers,
- Intratumoral heterogeneity in lung cancers.
