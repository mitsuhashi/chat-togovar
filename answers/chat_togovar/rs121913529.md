The allele frequency of rs121913529 specific to Japanese populations is not provided in the data from the TogoVar API results you supplied. The allele frequency provided is for broader datasets, such as "gnomAD Exomes" and "gnomAD Genomes," which do not differentiate specifically for Japanese populations.

If you need population-specific allele frequencies, such data might be available in other population-specific databases like the "ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank)" database or the "1000 Genomes Project" phase 3 dataset, which includes frequencies for Japanese individuals.

For reference:
- gnomAD Exomes: The allele frequencies for rs121913529 are as follows:
  - C>A mutation: **6.85 × 10⁻⁷** (1/1,460,566 alleles)
  - C>G mutation: **1.37 × 10⁻⁶** (2/1,460,566 alleles)
  - C>T mutation: **2.74 × 10⁻⁶** (4/1,460,562 alleles)
