Currently, there is no detailed information available in the TogoVar API or other reliable resources about variants having similar effects or functional impacts to rs1170153450. The effects of individual variants are often assessed with respect to the gene, specific sequence change, and phenotypic outcomes, and comparisons require comprehensive research data that is not readily available for all variants.

If you are looking for functional similarity, it would help to assess other variants in the same genes (ASCL1 or PAH) that might impact key functional regions, such as the start codon (e.g., changes leading to predicted protein truncation) or regulatory sequences. Alternatively, exploring structural or functional predictions for similar sequence-level changes would require computational tools like SIFT, PolyPhen, or AlphaMissense.

If more information becomes available about comparable mutations, it could refine such predictions. Do you want to explore this further for a specific gene or region?
