Currently, the data provided and available through the TogoVar API does not specifically list variants with similar effects to rs587782044. However, detailed information about the rs587782044 variant is as follows:

---

### 1. Variant Information (1-1)
- **RS Number**: [rs587782044](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs587782044)  
- **Gene Name**: **CDH1**  
- **Transcript Name(s)**: 
  - ENST00000261769.10 (HGVS: `p.Ala563Thr` or `c.1687G>A`)
  - NM_004360.5 (HGVS: `p.Ala563Ser` or `c.1687G>T`)
- **Type of Variant**: Missense

---

### 2. Relationship with Diseases (1-2)
- **ClinVar Significance**:  
  - **c.1687G>A**: Associated with *Hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome* ([ClinVar link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/481681)).
  - **c.1687G>T**: Associated with *Hereditary diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma* and *Hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome* ([ClinVar link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/141834)).  

- **Functionality Predictions**:
  - **SIFT**:  
    - **c.1687G>A**: 0.0 (Damaging)  
    - **c.1687G>T**: 0.01 (Damaging)
  - **PolyPhen-2**:  
    - **c.1687G>A**: 0.887 (Probably damaging)  
    - **c.1687G>T**: 0.936â€“0.987 (Probably damaging)  
  - **AlphaMissense**:
    - **c.1687G>A**: 0.136 (Indeterminate)  
    - **c.1687G>T**: 0.1621 (Indeterminate)

---

### 3. Literature Context (1-3)
The rs587782044 variant and its missense substitutions are integrally related to *Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC)*, with pathogenic mechanisms stemming from deleterious mutations in the **CDH1** gene. The **CDH1** gene encodes E-cadherin, a protein crucial for cell adhesion, with functional disruptions contributing to increased risks of cancer metastasis.  

---

### 4. Population Frequency Comparison (1-4)
- The variants show extremely low allele frequencies in population data:
  - **c.1687G>T** (Ala563Ser):
    - Non-Japanese in gnomAD Exomes: 0.00000273  
    - Non-Japanese in gnomAD Genomes: 0.0000394  
    - Japanese population frequency: Not specifically reported.
  - **c.1687G>A** (Ala563Thr): No allele frequency data provided in gnomAD.

Note: There may be significant differences between populations due to founder effects or population structure.

### 5. GWAS/Phenotypic Association (1-5)
Currently, there are no direct Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) results explicitly linking this variant to phenotypic traits outside its association with *Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer* and related syndromes.

If you are seeking information about similar mutations, the most relevant approach is to analyze CDH1 missense variants resulting in alterations to E-cadherin's functional domains, such as mutations at other residues near **Ala563** or within the cadherin repeat regions, and evaluate them using tools like SIFT and PolyPhen.

For a focused exploration, additional computational or experimental studies would be needed.
