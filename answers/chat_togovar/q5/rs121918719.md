I cannot directly identify variants similar to rs121918719 without additional details or queries for comparison. However, let me provide you with the information requested about rs121918719 itself, and you may specify what criteria you'd like to use for finding "similar" effects (e.g., similar gene, predicted pathogenicity, associated disease).

**1-3. Literature association**:
- Studies frequently report this variant in the context of **lamellar ichthyosis** (a subtype of ARCI1). It arises due to a missense mutation (Arg143His) that disrupts the enzymatic function of transglutaminase 1, critical for skin barrier formation.
- Specific citations were not provided in the TogoVar dataset, but this variant is a well-established cause of the disease in relevant genetic studies.

**1-4. Allele frequency comparison**:
- **Japanese population (ToMMo)**: AF = 0.000018 (~0.0018%)
- **Non-Japanese population (gnomAD)**:
  - Exomes: AF = 0.0000157 (~0.00157%)
  - Genomes: AF = 0.00000657 (~0.000657%)

This variant is rare in all populations, appearing at nearly similar frequencies globally.

**1-5. GWAS phenotypes**:
- No GWAS data was associated with this specific variant in the TogoVar dataset, though it is strongly linked to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) in clinical reports.
