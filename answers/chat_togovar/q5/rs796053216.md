The following information is related to the rs796053216 variant and its similar effects:

### Variant Information (1-1)
- **rs Number**: [rs796053216](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs796053216)
- **Gene**: SCN8A
- **HGVS**: Multiple annotations exist for this variant, such as:
  - Transcripts with cDNA annotation: e.g., NM_014191.4:c.4423G>A and NM_014191.4:c.4423G>C
  - Protein-level annotations: p.Gly1475Arg or p.Gly1434Arg based on isoform.
- **Transcript Names**: Multiple transcripts, such as ENST00000354534 and ENST00000355133.

### Disease Associations (1-2)
The rs796053216 variant has been curated in the context of specific diseases in **ClinVar**:
- **Likely Pathogenic (LP)** or **Pathogenic (P)** interpretations have been associated with conditions such as:
  - Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, 13 (MedGen: C3281191)
  - Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression bursts (MedGen: C0393706)
  - Epileptic encephalopathy (MedGen: C0543888)
  - Epilepsy (MedGen: C0014544)

In silico prediction tools indicate potential impact:
- **SIFT**: 0.02 (Damaging)
- **PolyPhen-2**: Variable scores across transcripts, ranging up to 0.567 (Possibly Damaging)
- **AlphaMissense**: 0.7968 (High probability of pathogenicity)

Variants with similar effects may impact the **SCN8A gene** (coding for a sodium channel protein, Nav1.6), which is crucial for neuronal excitability. Variants that disrupt highly conserved residues in SCN8A often cause severe epileptic phenotypes or neurodevelopmental disorders due to gain-of-function or loss-of-function effects.

---
### Population Allele Frequencies (1-4)
This specific variant (rs796053216) has not been observed in control populations, including Japanese and global cohorts (allele frequency **0.0** in gnomAD exomes with an allele count (AC) of **0**). This lack of presence in healthy individuals aligns with its pathogenic classification.

Variants with similar characteristics (absent from control populations and linked to SCN8A-related disorders) could represent de novo mutations or rare inherited forms causing neurodevelopmental conditions.

---
### GWAS and Phenotypes (1-5)
No specific **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)** directly mention this variant. However, SCN8A variants broadly connect with the phenotype **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy** in functional studies and case reports.

---
### Relevant Literature (1-3)
Numerous articles describe the pathogenic role of SCN8A missense variants in severe **neurodevelopmental disorders**:
- For instance, Gly-to-Arg substitutions at conserved residues in SCN8A are often reported in studies of **pediatric epilepsy syndromes**.
- A detailed evaluation of p.Gly1475Arg could be obtained by further exploring disease-specific cohort sequencing.
