Currently, no direct information is available about variants that have similar effects to rs794726784 using the TogoVar API or other provided sources. To identify such variants, you may need to explore other databases, such as ClinVar, dbSNP, or gnomAD, for known variants within the same or related genes (e.g., **SCN1A**) and their associations with diseases like epilepsy.

Hereâ€™s the information I can provide about rs794726784:

### 1-1: rs794726784 Variant Details
- **rs Number:** [rs794726784](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs794726784)
- **HGVS Notation:**
  - Genomic: `chr2:g.166002533C>T`
  - Transcript:
    - Example: `ENST00000303395.9:c.4223G>A` | Protein: `p.Trp1408Ter`
- **Gene Name:** SCN1A (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 1)
- **Transcript Name:** Multiple SCN1A transcripts affected (e.g., ENST00000303395)

### 1-2: Disease Relationship
This variant is pathogenic (P) and linked to:
- **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (SMEI)** ([ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/189947), MedGen: C0751122)
- **Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 2 (GEFSP2)** (MedGen: C1858673)

### 1-3: Literature
The specific literature linked to rs794726784 is not provided by the TogoVar API. Searching for studies on SCN1A in PubMed could yield insights into other variants with similar effects.

### 1-4: Population Frequencies
No allele frequency data is available in the dataset for this variant. This reveals either rarity or absence in surveyed populations.

### 1-5: GWAS Phenotype
No GWAS data is specifically linked to rs794726784 in the provided information. Variants in SCN1A are well-known for epilepsy-related phenotypes.

### Suggestions for Finding Similar Variants
To identify variants with similar effects:
1. Review other **nonsense or stop-gain mutations** in SCN1A, as rs794726784 results in a premature stop codon (e.g., p.Trp1408Ter).
2. Use tools like ClinVar or the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) to evaluate annotated SCN1A variants causing epilepsy.
3. Examine published epilepsy GWAS studies or variant catalogs in epilepsy databases like EpilepsyGene or SFARI.
