The rs121913279 variant is associated with missense alterations in the **PIK3CA** gene and has been studied for its implications in various cancers and overgrowth syndromes. Below is the information correlating to similar effects of this variant:

### Relevant Variants with Similar Effects
Variants in **PIK3CA**, particularly in the same codon as rs121913279 (His1047), or at other functionally important loci, often exhibit similar pathological associations.

#### 1. rs121913279 (A>G)
   - **Gene**: PIK3CA
   - **Transcript ID**: ENST00000263967
   - **HGVS**:
     - Protein: p.His1047Arg
     - cDNA: c.3140A>G
   - **Functional Prediction**:
     - SIFT: 0.0 (deleterious)
     - PolyPhen-2: 0.088 (benign)
     - AlphaMissense: 0.5381
   - **Related Diseases**: Associated with CLOVES syndrome, colorectal and breast cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma, and others (ClinVar shows pathogenic/likely pathogenic interpretations for various disorders).

#### 2. rs121913279 (A>T)
   - **Gene**: PIK3CA
   - **Transcript ID**: ENST00000263967
   - **HGVS**:
     - Protein: p.His1047Leu
     - cDNA: c.3140A>T
   - **Functional Prediction**:
     - SIFT: 0.07 (deleterious)
     - PolyPhen-2: 0.007 (benign)
     - AlphaMissense: 0.438
   - **Related Diseases**: Involved in diseases overlapping rs121913279 (A>G), including CLOVES syndrome and certain cancers, such as colorectal and breast cancers.

Other substitutions at the **His1047** residue in **PIK3CA** (e.g., p.His1047Pro or p.His1047Gln) have been identified as clinically significant. These substitutions typically increase the enzymatic activity of PI3K, significantly impacting cell proliferation and survival pathways, which contributes to oncogenesis.

### Most Frequent Disease Associations
Most variants of **PIK3CA** affecting **His1047** are present in:
- CLOVES syndrome and other overgrowth syndromes (PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum or PROS).
- A variety of cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Population Allele Frequencies
The rs121913279 variant (A>G) is rare, with a variant allele frequency of approximately 0.0001 in the Japanese population as per GEM Japan Whole Genome Aggregation. Data on allele frequency for non-Japanese populations is sparse but also typically remains low (<0.001). This rarity emphasizes its importance in case-specific genetic or oncological studies.

### Similar Missense Effects in Oncogenesis
Other frequently mutated loci in **PIK3CA**, such as codons 542 (e.g., p.Glu542Lys) and 545 (e.g., p.Glu545Lys), within the helical domain, also result in gain-of-function mutations contributing to a similar pathogenic profile.
