The provided information specifically pertains to rs431905511, a missense variant in the **SNCA** gene associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). If you’re looking for variants with similar effects, we can analyze other missense mutations in the **SNCA** gene or variants involved in PD. Here's a breakdown of related aspects:

---

### Similar Variant Effects in SNCA
To identify variants with effects like rs431905511, we consider:
1. **Gene**: Variants in **SNCA**, which encodes alpha-synuclein. Missense variants often alter protein function and are linked to neurodegenerative conditions like PD.
2. **Functional Impact**: Similar missense mutations in SNCA that result in protein changes, especially at conserved residues, are of interest.

### Notable Similar Variants in SNCA
Several SNCA missense variants are well-studied in Parkinson's disease research:
- **rs104893877 (p.Ala53Thr)**: A well-known pathogenic variant for PD involving a single amino acid change (A53T). It disrupts alpha-synuclein aggregation and is linked to early-onset PD.
  [Source: https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs104893877]

- **p.Glu46Lys (E46K)**: A rare missense mutation associated with familial PD. It influences protein oligomerization, a key pathological hallmark of synucleinopathies.
  [Study: Polymeropoulos et al., Science, 1997]

- **p.His50Gln (H50Q)**: Another variant affecting alpha-synuclein aggregation and linked to late-onset PD in some populations.

- **p.Ala53Glu (A53E)**: A recently identified missense mutation that shares similar effects, impacting aggregation dynamics.

### Disease Association
These variants are mainly associated with familial or autosomal dominant Parkinsonism or more broadly categorized synucleinopathies.

- Common features include disrupted protein folding or aggregation and altered interaction with cellular stress pathways.

- Some variants, like **A53T** and **E46K**, also manifest in individuals with earlier onset and more rapid disease progression compared to sporadic PD.

### Similarity Based on Computational Predictions
If you’re considering predictive tools like SIFT, PolyPhen, or AlphaMissense, these tools evaluate the potential deleterious impact of amino acid substitutions. Variants with comparable low SIFT scores (e.g., <0.05) and high PolyPhen scores (e.g., >0.9) are likely to exhibit effects similar to rs431905511.

- For rs431905511, **SIFT = 0.03**, **PolyPhen = 0.996**, and **AlphaMissense = 0.7612**.
- Variants with similar scores in SNCA or related genes (e.g., **LRRK2** or **GBA** for PD) may produce overlapping phenotypic effects.
