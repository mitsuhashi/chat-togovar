**c. C > T (tgv417528643)**  
   - rsID: **rs121913529**  
   - **Gene Name:** KRAS  
   - Most severe effect: Missense variant (*SO_0001583*)  
   - HGVS (amino acid/predicted change): **c.35G>A (p.Gly12Asp)**  
   - Pathogenicity: **Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic (P/LP)** in ClinVar  
   - AlphaMissense: **0.9984** (high pathogenicity estimate)  
   - PolyPhen-2: **0.653**  
   - SIFT: **0.03**  
   - TogoVar URL: [C > T Specific Page on TogoVar](https://mgend.ncgm.go.jp/variant/info/SNV|hg38|chr12:25245350-25245350|gC>T)  

- Disease associations (ClinVar): Found in conditions such as **lynch syndrome**, **gastric cancer**, **pancreatic cancer**, and **non-small cell lung carcinoma**. It has been implicated in conditions affecting the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, especially **RASopathies**.

### **2. Similarities in Function and Disease Associations**
- These alternates share the **same gene (KRAS)** and involve substitutions at the **same codon (p.Gly12)**, which is a hotspot for oncogenic mutations.  
- All the variants result in missense mutations, altering the function of the KRAS protein (specifically its GTPase activity).  
- ClinVar interpretations commonly classify these variants as **pathogenic** or **likely pathogenic**, associated with cancer phenotypes such as **colorectal, pancreatic, lung adenocarcinoma, neuroblastoma**, and more.

---

### **3. GWAS Insights and Population Frequencies**
- GWAS: No specific GWAS hits are documented. These KRAS variants are primarily studied in the context of somatic mutations in cancers rather than germline variants involved in population-level traits.  
- Population Frequencies: The alternate KRAS variants, including rs121913529, show extremely low allele frequencies (<1e-5 in gnomAD Exomes and Genomes), likely due to their pathogenic role and negative selection.
