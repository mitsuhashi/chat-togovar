The rs794726721 variant has two alternate alleles on chromosome 2 at position 166037994, with reported consequences related to the **SCN1A** gene, which is clinically relevant.

### Information Collected for rs794726721:

#### Gene and Transcripts
- **Gene**: **SCN1A**
    - Synonyms: Nav1.1, GEFSP2, HBSCI, NAC1, SMEI
- Listed transcripts and HGVS annotations:
    - **ENST00000303395.9:c.2728C>T** (p.Gln910Ter; nonsense mutation)
    - **ENST00000375405.7:c.2695C>T** (p.Gln899Ter; nonsense mutation)
    - **NM_001165963.4:c.2728C>T** (p.Gln910Ter)
    - **NM_006920.6:c.2695C>A** (p.Gln899Lys; missense mutation)

#### Clinical Significance
- The variant has been linked to **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (SMEI)**, identified as:
    - Likely Pathogenic (LP) for the **G>A substitution** (causing nonsense termination).
    - Pathogenic (P) for the **G>T substitution** (resulting in an amino acid change).

#### Computational Predictions
- The G>T (missense substitution) scored:
    - **SIFT**: 0.0 (Damaging)
    - **PolyPhen**: 0.982 (Probably Damaging)
    - **AlphaMissense**: 0.9868 (High Pathogenicity Prediction)
- For the G>A (nonsense variant), computational predictions like SIFT/PolyPhen are not applicable due to the nature of the premature stop codon.

### Variants with Similar Effects:
Variants with similar effects to rs794726721 would generally cause **truncated proteins** (e.g., nonsense or frameshift mutations) or **missense mutations leading to highly deleterious changes** in the **SCN1A** gene. Here are some examples based on general knowledge of **SCN1A** pathogenic variants:

#### 1. SCN1A Nonsense Variants
Nonsense mutations causing premature termination (like rs794726721:G>A) are commonly pathogenic in **SCN1A**. Examples include:
- **c.3527C>T (p.Arg1176Ter)**: A known pathogenic variant causing a premature stop codon, linked to SMEI.
- **c.1651C>T (p.Arg551Ter)**: Associated with SMEI due to truncation.

#### 2. SCN1A Missense Variants
Deleterious missense mutations involving highly conserved residues (like rs794726721:G>T) can disrupt channel function:
- **c.3894C>A (p.Phe1298Leu)**: A pathogenic variant affecting pore-forming or gating regions, leading to SMEI.
- **c.2249G>A (p.Arg750Gln)**: Known to disrupt sodium channel gating in SMEI.

#### Predictions from Functional Domains
Since the rs794726721 variant occurs within regions critical for sodium channel function, other pathogenic variants in **similar regions (e.g., pore-forming S5-S6 segments or voltage-sensing domains)** are likely to have similar effects.
