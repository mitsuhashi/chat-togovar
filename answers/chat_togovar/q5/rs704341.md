There is no direct information available from the TogoVar API or curated evidence regarding variants that exhibit similar effects to the rs704341 variant. However, I can provide details about rs704341 itself so that you may explore related variants or their functional impact:

### Information for rs704341 Variant:

#### **1-1. Variant Details**
- **rs Number**: rs704341  
- **HGVS**: Multiple transcript-based HGVS annotations (e.g., **ENST00000295874.14:c.191-26563G>A**)  
- **Gene Name**: PTPRG (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type G)  
- **Transcript Name**:
  - ENST00000295874
  - ENST00000474889
  - NM_001375471.1
  - NM_002841.4
  - ... and others (in total, 9 transcripts).  
- This substitution occurs at chromosome 3, position 61963062, with a G>A change.

#### **1-2. Relationship with Diseases and Functional Predictions**
- **ClinVar**: No assertion of clinical significance (classified as **"NC"** - No Clinical Significance).  
- **Predictive Tools**: Information from AlphaMissense, SIFT, and Polyphen is not provided for this variant, so its predicted functional effect cannot be directly inferred (e.g., benign, pathogenic, etc.).  

#### **1-3. Literature Evidence**
- There is no specific literature cited in the TogoVar API for rs704341.  

#### **1-4. Allele Frequency Comparison**
- Frequencies among different populations (data from multiple sources):  
  - **Japanese (TOMMO)**: 0.0158 (1.58%)  
  - **Non-Japanese (gnomAD Genomes)**: 0.1119 (11.19%)  
  - Other studies confirm variation in allele frequency across global populations.
  - The frequency is notably higher in non-Japanese populations, suggesting population-specific variability.

#### **1-5. GWAS Results**
- There are no GWAS-associated phenotypes or traits linked to rs704341 based on the information from the TogoVar API.

#### **1-6. TogoVar Link**

### Suggested Exploration for Variants with Similar Effects:
To investigate variants with similar effects, try exploring functionally linked variants in the **PTPRG gene** (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type G), particularly in regions with similar allele frequencies or potential regulatory impacts. The **most severe consequence** for rs704341 is classified as **SO_0001627** ("intron variant"), meaning it occurs in a non-coding region, so other intronic variants within PTPRG could be candidates for further study.

You can use tools such as:
- **ClinVar**: Search for variants within the PTPRG gene.
- **gnomAD**: Explore intronic variants and their allele frequencies.
- **GWAS Catalog**: Investigate other variants linked to traits in the same genomic region.

For now, no specific variant with similar effects to rs704341 could be identified from the data provided.
