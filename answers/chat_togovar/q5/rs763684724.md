Currently, no information is explicitly available from the TogoVar API or curated sources like ClinVar that offer a direct list of variants with effects similar to rs763684724. However, I can break down the available data for this variant and offer potential directions for identifying similar effects:

### Information About rs763684724
Here’s what is known about **rs763684724**:

1. **Gene/Transcript Information** ([source](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs763684724), [TogoVar link](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/19-35033886-C-T?dataset=gnomad_r4)):
   - Gene: **SCN1B** (sodium voltage-gated channel beta subunit 1).
   - Most damaging transcript effect:
     - Transcript: **ENST00000415950.5**  
     - HGVS: **ENST00000415950.5:c.595C>T**, protein change **p.Pro199Ser**.
     - SIFT score: 0.07 (predicted as "damaging").
     - PolyPhen score: 0.108 (predicted as "benign").

   This gene plays an important role in modulating ion channels, which are critical for neuronal signaling.

2. **Disease Association and Predictions**:
   - No direct pathogenic disease association in ClinVar.
   - The SIFT score suggests the substitution may impair protein function, while PolyPhen suggests it might be benign — this discrepancy indicates uncertainty in its functional effect.

3. **Population Frequency**: Rare variant.
   - Frequency in gnomAD:
     - Exomes: 1.38e-06 (2 alleles in 1,445,174 analyzed).
     - Genomes: 6.57e-06 (1 allele in 152,112 analyzed).

### Identifying Variants With Similar Effects:
Although no direct matches are listed in the data provided, you can look for variants in **SCN1B** (or homologous genes) with functional consequences in similar biological contexts. Below are steps to identify candidates:

#### 1. Variants in SCN1B Impacting the Same Domain:
   - **p.Pro199Ser** and **p.Pro166Ser** in SCN1B suggest variants causing missense substitutions (SO_0001583) in similar protein regions may have comparable effects.
   - Investigate other missense variants in gnomAD or ClinVar located in **SCN extracellular domain** or other critical functional regions.

#### 2. Variants Sharing Consequence Classifications:
   - Variants leading to **missense substitutions** (SO_0001583) in sodium-channel genes like SCN1A, SCN2B, or SCN3B might share functional effects, especially in terms of ion channel regulation.

#### 3. Variants With Similar Functional Predictions (SIFT, PolyPhen):
   - Search for rare variants with similar ranges of **SIFT** (damaging) and/or **PolyPhen** scores, either in SCN1B or related ion-channel genes.

#### 4. GWAS and Phenotypic Context:
   - Variants in SCN1B have been linked to epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmias, and ion-channel disorders. Look at GWAS or curated resources for variants linked to **neural or cardiac phenotypes**.

For a comprehensive and automated comparison, tools like the **gnomAD browser**, **ClinVar**, or machine learning-based predictors (e.g., AlphaMissense, MutationTaster) can be used to identify additional rare missense variants for comparison.
