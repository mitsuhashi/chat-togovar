### **1-2. Relationship with Diseases**
- **ClinVar Disease Associations**:
  - Frequently linked to cancers, including:
    - Non-small cell lung carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
    - Other associated conditions: Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, RASopathy, and gastric cancers.
    - Interpreted mostly as **Pathogenic (P)** and **Likely Pathogenic (LP)** in these disorders.
- **Curated Predictions**:
  - **SIFT**: Scores range from **0.0 to 0.14**, indicating **deleterious** predictions.
  - **PolyPhen-2**: Scores range from **0.041 to 0.985**, with some predictions being **probably damaging**.
  - **AlphaMissense**: High scores (up to **0.9984**), supporting likely pathogenic effects.

### **1-3. Literature**
This variant is widely reported in the literature, particularly in association with its role in cancer (e.g., pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers). For example, codon 12 of KRAS (where this mutation occurs) is a hot spot for oncogenic mutations.

### **1-4. Allele Frequencies**
- **Global Frequency** (Using gnomAD data):
  - **C>A** (Gly12Val): ~**6.85 × 10⁻⁷**
  - **C>G** (Gly12Ala): ~**1.37 × 10⁻⁶**
  - **C>T** (Gly12Asp): ~**2.74 × 10⁻⁶** (exomes); ~**1.31 × 10⁻⁵** (genomes)
- Allele frequencies suggest this is a rare variant, seen very infrequently in global datasets.
- Population-specific frequency differences among Japanese and non-Japanese groups are currently unavailable for this specific query.

---

### **1-5. GWAS and Phenotypes**
- This variant has been linked to cancer phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Specifically, somatic mutations in **KRAS** codon 12 are well-documented drivers of tumorigenesis, especially in adenocarcinomas of colorectal, pancreatic, and lung origins.
