### Summary of rs796053216

#### 1-1. Variant Information
- **rs Number**: [rs796053216](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs796053216)
- **HGVS (Representative Transcript)**: 
  - NM_001330260.2: c.4423G>A (p.Gly1475Arg)
  - NM_001330260.2: c.4423G>C (p.Gly1475Arg)
- **Gene Name**: *SCN8A* (Sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 8)
- **Transcript Name**: Multiple transcripts are affected; key examples include:
  - ENST00000354534.11 (GRCh37/38 position: chr12:g.51790401G>A/C)

#### 1-2. Disease Associations
- The variant is associated with the gene *SCN8A*, which plays a major role in neuronal excitability.
- **ClinVar Data**: 
  - Multiple submissions link this variant to epilepsy-related disorders. Notable interpretations and associated conditions include:
    - Likely Pathogenic (LP) and Pathogenic (P): Associated with *Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 13*, *Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression bursts*, and *Epilepsy*.
    - Not Provided (NP): Associated with *Complex neurodevelopmental disorder*.
- **Predictive Tools**: 
  - **SIFT**: 0.02 (deleterious)  
  - **PolyPhen-2**: Range from 0.223 to 0.567 (possibly damaging depending on the transcript)  
  - **AlphaMissense**: 0.7968 (highly likely to have functional impact)

#### 1-3. Literature Evidence
There is currently no detailed literature summarized here, but *SCN8A* and its variants are well-documented for their role in epileptic encephalopathies.

#### 1-4. Allele Frequencies
- This variant has been reported as extremely rare or absent from large population datasets:
  - **gnomAD Exomes**: Allele count (0), Frequency = 0.0 in 1,451,118 chromosomes.
- No specific population differences between Japanese and non-Japanese individuals are reported, implying that the variant is exceedingly rare across all populations.

#### 1-5. GWAS Data
GWAS results specifically linking this variant to particular phenotypes remain unavailable. However, related phenotypes like seizures and neurodevelopmental disorders are indicative of disruption in *SCN8A* function.
