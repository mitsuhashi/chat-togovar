The variant rs727504136 is associated with the **SCN1A** gene, which encodes the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1, essential in the function of neurons. Below is a detailed summary:

---

### 1. **Basic Information**:
- **rs Number**: [rs727504136](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs727504136)
- **HGVS Notation**: 
  - Genomic: `chr2:g.166012255G>A`
  - Transcripts (examples):
    - `NM_006920.6:c.3700C>T` leading to a protein change `p.Arg1234Ter`
    - `NM_001202435.3:c.3733C>T` leading to `p.Arg1245Ter` (stop-gain)
- **Gene Name**: SCN1A (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 1)
- **Transcript Name**: Multiple transcript variants including `ENST00000303395` and `ENST00000375405`.

### 2. **Relationship with Diseases**:
The variant is labeled **pathogenic (P)** in **ClinVar** and is associated with several neurological disorders:
- **Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (Dravet syndrome)**: A severe form of epileptic encephalopathy.
- **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 6B (DEE6B)**.
- **Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, type 2 (GEFSP2)**.
- **Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression bursts**.
- **Migraine, familial hemiplegic 3**.

### 3. **Literature**:
Multiple studies have reported this variant as a contributor to **epileptic encephalopathies** and are available in publications related to variants in SCN1A for Dravet syndrome and related conditions. Detailed case studies often document these findings.

---

### 4. **Population Frequency**:
No allele frequency data is currently available from TogoVar or other population-specific databases. This suggests that this variant might be extremely rare or possibly private (only present in affected individuals).

---

### 5. **Functional Annotation and Predictions**:
- **Most severe consequence**: **Stop-gain mutation (SO_0001587)**, leading to protein truncation.
- No prediction results for **SIFT**, **PolyPhen**, or **AlphaMissense** are included in the TogoVar data.
