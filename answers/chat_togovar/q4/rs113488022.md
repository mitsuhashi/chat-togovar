Here is a summary of the information retrieved about rs113488022 from the provided TogoVar API results, relevant to the requested categories:

### 1. General Variant Details (1-1):
- **rs number**: rs113488022
- **Gene name**: *BRAF*
- **Chr position (GRCh38)**: 7:140753336
- **Variant types**: Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with alternate alleles "C," "G," and "T."
- **HGVS details**:
  - Example for the "C" allele in transcript ENST00000288602: `chr7:g.140753336A>C`, `ENST00000288602.11:c.1919T>G`, `ENSP00000288602.7:p.Val640Gly`.
  - Example for "T" allele in transcript NM_004333.6: `chr7:g.140753336A>T`, `NM_004333.6:c.1799T>A`, `NP_004324.2:p.Val600Glu`.

### 2. Clinical Significance and Disease Relationships (1-2):
- From ClinVar, associations have been made between this variant and multiple diseases and phenotypes:
  - **Pathogenic (P):**
    - Diseases such as Melanoma, RASopathy, Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, and Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma.
  - **Likely Pathogenic (LP):**
    - Conditions such as Multiple Myeloma, Malignant Melanoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Glioblastoma.
  - **Uncertain significance (US) or conflicting interpretations**:
    - Non-specific conditions such as “not provided.”
  - **Condition-specific clinical evidence** includes cancers such as colorectal cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian neoplasms, and others.
- **Predictions**:
  - SIFT: Predicted as deleterious (score 0.0).
  - PolyPhen: Varied scores depending on the transcript (e.g., 0.958 for "C" allele and up to 0.935 for "T" allele), ranging from benign to probably damaging.
  - AlphaMissense: Predicted as high effect e.g., for the "C" allele (0.9773) and "T" allele (0.9927).

### 3. Population Frequency (1-4):
- In general, the alternate allele "T" has a very low frequency in gnomAD Exomes dataset:
  - Allele frequency (AF): 1.369e-06 (1 in ~730,000 individuals).
- No allele-specific frequency data for Japanese and non-Japanese populations is provided in this API result.

### 4. GWAS/Phenotype Information (1-5):
- No specific GWAS-related results or phenotype associations beyond the curated diseases are mentioned.

### 5. Link to External Pages (1-6):

  - ClinVar entries for the major alleles:
    - A>C: [VCV000040389](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/40389)
    - A>T: [VCV000013961](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/13961)
    - A>G: [VCV000376288](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/376288)

### 6. Most Severe Functional Consequences:
- The alternate alleles affect the *BRAF* protein at highly relevant positions critical for its function:
  - A>C: Example `p.Val600Gly` in canonical transcript, disrupting potential kinase domain activity.
  - A>T: Example `p.Val600Glu` is a well-documented oncogenic driver mutation in cancers.
