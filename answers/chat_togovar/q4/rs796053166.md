### 1-2. **ClinVar (Relationship with Diseases)**:
- Variations in this locus are associated with several **neurodevelopmental and epileptic syndromes**, specifically involving **SCN2A**. ClinVar information includes:
    - **Pathogenic/likely pathogenic conditions** for certain variants:
        - **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, type 11 (DEE11)** ([MedGen: C3150987](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C3150987))
        - **Seizures, benign familial infantile, type 3 (BFIS3)** ([MedGen: C1843140](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C1843140))
    - Specific variants include:
        - **C>A**: Likely benign (LB) in some cases.
        - **C>T**: Leads to a stop codon (p.Arg1882Ter; pathogenic).
        - **C>G**: p.Arg1882Gly; pathogenic.
- **Functional Predictions** for missense changes (C>G):
    - **SIFT**: 0.0 (damaging).
    - **AlphaMissense**: 0.8635 (high probability of pathogenicity).
    - **PolyPhen**: Not available.

### Summary:
The variant **rs796053166** in the **SCN2A** gene demonstrates highly variable effects depending on the nucleotide change. It can result in benign (C>A), missense (C>G; p.Arg1882Gly), or nonsense (C>T; p.Arg1882Ter) outcomes. Pathogenic changes at this site are tightly linked to **developmental and epileptic encephalopathies**.
