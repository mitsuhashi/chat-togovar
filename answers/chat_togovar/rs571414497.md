**1-2. Disease Associations and Pathogenicity Predictions:**
- **Curated Data (ClinVar):** No clinical significance classified (marked as "NC").  
- **Prediction Tools:**  
  - **AlphaMissense:** Score = 0.1493 (low likelihood of pathogenicity).  
  - **SIFT:** Score = 1.0 (tolerated).  
  - **PolyPhen:** Score = 0.02 or 0.009 (benign across transcripts).  

This indicates the variant likely has no strong adverse impact on protein function or associated disease.

**1-4. Population Frequencies:**
- **In gnomAD (Exomes):** The allele frequency (AF) is **8.89e-06**.
- **In gnomAD (Genomes):** The allele frequency is **6.56e-06**.
- **In the Japanese NCBI dataset:** The allele frequency is **4.25e-05**.  

The frequency is higher in the Japanese population compared to gnomAD exome/genome data, but it remains very low, suggesting the variant is rare in all populations.

**Conclusion:**
There is no strong evidence that rs571414497 influences clinical phenotypes or diseases. The variant occurs in the gene **ALOXE3**, which is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the skin. However, the predictions (PolyPhen, SIFT, AlphaMissense) indicate that this variant **p.Ile87Val** is benign and has little or no functional impact. Additionally, it is categorized as "NC" (no clinical significance) in ClinVar, and no GWAS datasets link it to any specific phenotype.
