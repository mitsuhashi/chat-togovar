Here is the available information on the rs571414497 (chr17:g.8116869T>C) variant:

### 1-1. Variant Information
- **rs Number**: [rs571414497](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs571414497)
- **Gene Name**: ALOXE3 (Arachidonate Lipoxygenase 3)
- **HGVS Nomenclature**:
  - Genomic: chr17:g.8116869T>C
  - Protein: Varies by transcript, such as ENSP00000314879.4:p.Ile87Val
  - cDNA: Varies by transcript, such as ENST00000318227.4:c.259A>G
- **Transcript Names**: Several transcripts are affected, including ENST00000318227, NM_001369446.1, NM_021628.3, etc.

### 1-2. Disease Relationships and Predictive Scores
- **Curated Clinical Significance**: Classified as "NC" (No Clinical Significance) according to the TogoVar API.
- **Computational Predictions**:
  - **AlphaMissense**: 0.1493 (likely benign)
  - **SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant)**: Score of 1.0, suggesting the variant is "Tolerated."
  - **PolyPhen (Polymorphism Phenotyping)**: Score of 0.009–0.02, categorized as "Benign."

These predictions indicate minimal to no impact on the structure or functional properties of the ALOXE3 protein.

### 1-3. Literature Evidence
There is no directly cited literature evidence for rs571414497 in the provided TogoVar dataset. Further manual review of external databases such as PubMed may be needed for detailed findings.

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies in Populations
- **Japanese Population**: Frequency not explicitly mentioned in the available dataset.
- **Global Populations**:
  - **gnomAD Exomes**: AF = 8.89 × 10⁻⁶
  - **gnomAD Genomes**: AF = 6.56 × 10⁻⁶
  - **NCBN Dataset**: AF = 4.25 × 10⁻⁵
  
These low frequencies suggest the variant is exceptionally rare in both Japanese and non-Japanese populations.

### 1-5. Phenotypic Association (GWAS)
No phenotype associations with rs571414497 were identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on the TogoVar API dataset.

### 1-6. TogoVar Link

---
### Conclusion:
The rs571414497 variant (T>C in the ALOXE3 gene) has minor computationally predicted effects on protein function and is extremely rare in global populations. Based on the benign scores from multiple prediction tools (AlphaMissense, SIFT, and PolyPhen) and a lack of disease associations, this variant is unlikely to significantly affect the structure or function of the ALOXE3 gene or protein. Further experimental validation would be required to confirm this.
