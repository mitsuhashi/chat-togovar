The variant **rs113488022** is associated with the **BRAF** gene, which is known for its critical role in cancer (e.g., melanoma, colorectal cancer, and others). Whether it can be a target for genome editing with CRISPR depends on the intended application and context:

1. **Link Information** (1-1):
   - **rs number:** rs113488022 
   - **HGVS:** Multiple transcript-specific designations are listed in TogoVar; for example, **NM_004333.6:c.1799T>A** corresponding to a missense change in BRAF.  
   - **Gene:** BRAF.  
   - **Transcript example:** **NM_004333.6**.

2. **Relationship with Diseases** (1-2):  
   - This variant is classified as "Pathogenic" in ClinVar for several cancer-related conditions (e.g., melanoma, colorectal cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma).
   - Prediction tools like **SIFT, PolyPhen, and AlphaMissense** indicate strong deleterious impacts, e.g., **SIFT: 0.0**, **PolyPhen: 0.935**, and **AlphaMissense: 0.9927**.

3. **Application in Genome Editing**:  
   - **CRISPR suitability:** Genome editing using CRISPR technology could potentially target this variant to correct the pathogenic mutation or model disease states. However, practical suitability depends on several factors:
     - **Location-specific CRISPR guide RNA design:** Suitable protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences must be available near the specific position (**chr7:140753336**) for efficient editing.
     - **Cancer-specific context:** The utility might involve correcting somatic mutations in experimental settings (e.g., using cell lines or organoids) to study disease mechanisms.
     - **Therapeutic implications:** Editing somatic mutations in patients (such as this oncogenic variant) is still experimental, especially due to off-target risks.

4. **Additional Considerations**:  
   - Because BRAF is an oncogene, editing must be performed with extreme caution to avoid unintended consequences in cancer pathways.
   - For cancer treatment, alternative strategies (e.g., BRAF inhibitors like vemurafenib) are already in clinical use, making CRISPR potentially more applicable to research than therapy at this stage.

Conclusion: While the **rs113488022** variant in **BRAF** could theoretically be a target for CRISPR, practical usage remains constrained by the state of current technologies, biological safety, and whether the focus is experimental (e.g., modeling) or therapeutic.
