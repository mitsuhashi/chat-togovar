The TogoVar API response does not provide explicit information about the evolutionary background of rs12037987. However, I can provide some insights based on genomic and allele frequency data.

### Allele Frequencies and Population Differences
1. **Japanese Populations**:
   - In the **jga_wes** dataset, the allele frequency (AF) is **0.0399** (3.99%).
   - In the **gem_j_wga** dataset, the AF is **0.298** (29.8%).
   - In the **jga_wgs** dataset, the AF is **0.3910** (39.1%).

2. **Non-Japanese Populations**:
   - In the **gnomAD Genomes** dataset (aggregated global dataset), the AF is **0.0889** (8.89%).
   - The **ncbn** dataset has an AF of **0.2625** (26.25%).

#### Evolutionary Implications:
The divergence in allele frequencies between Japanese and non-Japanese populations suggests possible population-specific selection or demographic history (e.g., genetic drift, founder effects, or regional adaptations). The relatively higher allele frequencies in Japanese datasets like **gem_j_wga** and **jga_wgs** might point to an evolutionary event impacting this variant within East Asian populations.

However, direct evolutionary or functional studies specific to rs12037987 would be required to provide a precise evolutionary explanation.
