I could not retrieve specific information about rs1235072590 from the TogoVar API, as the result indicates no associated data (`'filtered': 0`). However, based on your query, I will provide an explanation regarding how evolutionary background can generally be inferred for specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs):

SNPs like rs1235072590 can be studied in evolutionary contexts by analyzing their allelic variation across diverse populations, their presence in ancient genomes (from ancient DNA studies), and by examining their conservation across species. These factors help determine whether the variant has been conserved due to functional importance or whether it is more recent and specific to certain populations.

To determine the evolutionary background of rs1235072590 specifically, information such as allele frequencies across populations, phylogenetic data, and functional implications based on comparative genomics would be necessary. Unfortunately, since this specific SNP is not covered in the TogoVar database or provided here, no additional insight can currently be offered.

If you'd like me to attempt another source or approach a related query, please let me know!
