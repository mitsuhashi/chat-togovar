No specific information is available from the TogoVar API or within the provided dataset regarding the evolutionary background of rs796053216. The data primarily includes functional annotations, disease associations, allele frequencies, and predictive algorithms for pathogenicity, but evolutionary analysis is not included.

If you seek evolutionary insights, such as whether this variant is conserved across species or its potential role in evolution, further research using phylogenetic tools or specialized databases like UCSC Genome Browser or Ensembl Compara may be required. You can also focus on studying the SCN8A gene (associated with this variant), which plays a critical role in sodium channel function and likely underwent evolutionary forces due to its importance in nervous system functions.
