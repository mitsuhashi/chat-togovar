# ChatTogoVar

The TogoVar API does not provide direct information about the evolutionary background of rs796053166, such as its conservation across species or its emergence in different lineages during evolution. It primarily focuses on clinical significance, allele frequencies, and genomic context rather than evolutionary history.

If you have any particular population genetic or phylogenetic analysis in mind, additional literature searches or databases like UCSC Genome Browser (for conservation tracks) or Ensembl (for comparative genomics) might be helpful in determining the evolutionary context of this variant.
