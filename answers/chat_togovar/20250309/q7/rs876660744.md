The TogoVar API data provided does not include specific information about the evolutionary background of the rs876660744 variant. Evolutionary insights, such as selective pressures or conservation of this nucleotide position across species, would typically require comparative genomics or literature on population genetics. Unfortunately, this is not covered in the current dataset.

### General Insight:
Variants associated with the **CDH1** gene (to which rs876660744 belongs) might have evolutionary significance due to the gene's critical role in cell adhesion and tumor suppression. **CDH1's evolutionary conservation** can be explored through tools like UCSC Genome Browser or PhyloP scores, which indicate evolutionary constraint. However, additional sources would be needed for specific details. 

If you would like me to try to infer possible evolutionary significance or direct you to tools that can explore this further, let me know!
