The TogoVar API results provided do not include specific information regarding the evolutionary background of rs121913279, such as phylogenetic conservation, natural selection, or its presence in other species. Therefore, the evolutionary history of this variant cannot be derived directly from the submitted data.

If needed, evolutionary analyses of rs121913279 could be facilitated through computational tools like phyloP, PhastCons (based on conserved elements across species), or population genetics databases (such as 1000 Genomes) that store data on allele frequencies across diverse populations and epochs. Let me know if you would like guidance or resources for conducting such an analysis.
