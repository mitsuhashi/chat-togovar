### Information on rs763684724 and Its Clinical Implications:

#### 1-1. **Variant Information**  
- **rs Number**: [rs763684724](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs763684724)  
- **HGVS**:
  - **Genomic**: `chr19:g.35033886C>T`
  - **Transcript**:
    - `ENST00000415950.5:c.595C>T`, corresponding to the protein-level change `ENSP00000396915.2:p.Pro199Ser`
    - `ENST00000640135.1:c.496C>T`, corresponding to the protein-level change `ENSP00000492655.1:p.Pro166Ser`
  - Refers to the **SCN1B** gene.  

#### 1-2. **Disease Relationships**  
- **SCN1B** encodes a beta subunit for voltage-gated sodium channels, playing an essential role in modulating excitability in the nervous system.
- **Predictions**:
  - **SIFT**: Score = 0.06 (predicted as "possibly damaging").
  - **PolyPhen-2**: Score = 0.108 ("benign").
  - **AlphaMissense**: No information available.

While the variant appears to be functionally neutral or only mildly impactful based on computational predictions, experimental evidence or functional studies are necessary to confirm clinical relevance.

#### 1-3. **Variant in Literature**  
No specific literature references mentioning rs763684724 were found. Additional experimental research might clarify its phenotypic impacts.  

#### 1-4. **Allele Frequency in Populations**  
- **Non-Japanese Populations** (from gnomAD):
  - **Exomes**: Allele Frequency (AF) = 1.38 × 10^-6
  - **Genomes**: AF = 6.57 × 10^-6
- No information specific to Japanese populations is available. Generally, its allele frequency is extremely low across all studied populations, consistent with a rare or potentially pathogenic variant.

#### 1-5. **GWAS & Associated Phenotypes**  
No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explicitly link this variant to any phenotypes or clinical traits as of now. Since it is located in **SCN1B**, variants in this gene have been implicated in conditions like epilepsy (including generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, GEFS+). However, this variant has no direct association with these diseases yet.

#### 1-6. **TogoVar Link**

### Clinical Phenotype Influence  
- **Potential Mechanism**: As **SCN1B** is highly expressed in the brain and modulates voltage-gated sodium channels, variants could disrupt neural signaling, potentially contributing to epilepsy or neurodevelopmental disorders. However, specific evidence connecting rs763684724 to these disorders is currently lacking.
- Further functional studies or clinical evidence would be required to elucidate how (or if) rs763684724 impacts sodium channel function and subsequent phenotypes.
