### Influence on Clinical Phenotype:
The location of rs794727152 in the **SCN2A** gene is critical as it affects the encoding of the sodium channel. The specific amino acid changes (p.Arg853Gln and p.Arg853Pro) have been identified as pathogenic and are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including:
- **Epileptic encephalopathy**: Severe seizure disorders beginning in infancy.
- **Developmental delay**: Cognitive and motor skill delays due to impaired neuronal signaling.
- **Benign epilepsy**: Milder seizure disorders with a better prognosis compared to encephalopathy.

The broader clinical phenotype depends on whether the mutation leads to a gain- or loss-of-function in sodium channel activity, as both mechanisms have distinct pathological outcomes.
