The variant **rs796053166** is located in the **SCN2A gene**, which encodes the alpha subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel. Mutations in this gene are well documented to affect neuronal excitability and are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes, primarily neurodevelopmental and epileptic disorders. Below is the interpretation of available data about how this variant influences clinical phenotypes:

---

### **1. Variant Information**
- **Gene:** SCN2A (Sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 2)
- **Location:** Chromosome 2 at position 165389450, reference allele **C**.
- **Reported Alternate Alleles:**
  - **C>A**, **C>G**, **C>T**
- **Transcript-Related HGVS Descriptions:**
  - Multiple transcripts are affected; prominent ones include **ENST00000283256**, **ENST00000375437**, and **NM_001040142.2**.

---

### **2. Disease Associations and Clinical Significance**
The clinical phenotype depends on the specific nucleotide change at the rs796053166 location:

#### **2.1 C>A (chr2:g.165389450C>A)**
- **Disease Association:**
  - **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 11 (DEE11)** (MedGen: C3150987)
  - **Benign familial infantile seizures 3 (BFIS3)** (MedGen: C1843140)
- **Clinical Significance in ClinVar:**
  - Classified as **benign/likely benign (LB)**.
- Interpretation: This variant is less likely to cause pathogenic effects and may not directly influence clinical phenotypes.

#### **2.2 C>G (chr2:g.165389450C>G)**
- **Impact:**
  - Results in an amino acid change (missense mutation): **p.Arg1882Gly** in key transcripts like ENST00000283256.
- **Disease Association:**
  - **DEE11**
  - **BFIS3**
  - **Episodic ataxia type 9**
  - **Complex neurodevelopmental disorder**
- **ClinVar Significance:**
  - Classified as **pathogenic**.
- **Functional Predictions:**
  - **SIFT (deleterious):** Score = 0.0
  - **AlphaMissense:** Score = 0.8635 (strong evidence of pathogenicity).
- Interpretation: This variant significantly influences clinical phenotypes by disrupting sodium channel function, leading to severe neurodevelopmental and epileptic disorders.

#### **2.3 C>T (chr2:g.165389450C>T)**
- **Impact:**
  - Creates a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation): **p.Arg1882Ter**.
- **Disease Association:**
  - **DEE11**
  - **Inborn genetic diseases**
- **ClinVar Significance:**
  - Classified as **pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP)**.
- Interpretation: This variant introduces a truncating mutation, likely causing loss of functional protein, which strongly influences the development of severe syndromic epilepsies.

### **3. Mechanism of Pathogenicity**
- **SCN2A** is critical for neuronal action potential firing and excitation.
- Variants at rs796053166 alter the structure and function of SCN2A channels through:
  - **Missense Mutations (e.g., C>G):** Dysregulated ion transport dynamics.
  - **Nonsense Mutations (e.g., C>T):** Premature stop codons resulting in haploinsufficiency.

The impact of such mutations often correlates with distinct phenotypes:
- **Gain-of-function mutations** (mild DEE11, BFIS3).
- **Loss-of-function mutations** or truncations (severe DEE11, neurodevelopmental disorders).

---

### **4. Population Data**
- The variant is rare in the general population:
  - **C>A allele:**
    - Allele frequency in gnomAD exomes: 6.15e-06
    - Allele frequency in gnomAD genomes: 6.58e-06.
  - **C>G and C>T alleles:** Not reported in population datasets, reinforcing their pathogenicity.

### **5. Clinical Phenotypes**
#### **Key Disorders Linked to rs796053166 Mutations:**
- **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 11 (DEE11):**
  - Severe epilepsy, intellectual disability, and developmental delay.
- **Benign familial infantile seizures 3 (BFIS3):**
  - Mild seizure disorder with good remission prognosis.
- **Other conditions:**
  - Episodic ataxia (type 9) and complex neurodevelopmental phenotypes.
