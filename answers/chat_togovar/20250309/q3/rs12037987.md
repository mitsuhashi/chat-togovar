- **Variation**: T>C substitution at this location.

#### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases:
From the ClinVar database, there is no known clinical significance (not classified, **NC**) linked to rs12037987. Additionally, computational predictions from **AlphaMissense**, **SIFT**, and **PolyPhen** are unavailable for this variant.

#### 1-3. Relevant Literature:
Currently, no specific studies associating rs12037987 with clinical phenotypes or diseases are available in the accessible literature database.

#### 1-4. Allele Frequencies and Population Differences:
The allele frequencies of rs12037987 differ among global populations:
- **Japanese populations** (e.g., ToMMo, jga_wgs): Higher frequency (e.g., **29.9%** in GEM-J WGA and **39.1%** in JGA WGS), suggesting potential population-specific variability.
- **Non-Japanese populations** (e.g., gnomAD Genomes): Lower frequency (~**8.9%**).

This disparity could indicate population-specific evolutionary influences or genetic drift, though further research is required to determine functional implications.

#### 1-5. GWAS and Related Phenotypes:
No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) currently link rs12037987 with a specific phenotype.

#### 1-6. TogoVar Link:
