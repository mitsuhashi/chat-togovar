- **rs number**: rs121918719  
- **HGVS**: 
  - Genomic: chr14:g.24261775C>T  
  - Transcript (RefSeq): NM_000359.3:c.428G>A, NP_000350.1:p.Arg143His  
  - Transcript (Ensembl): ENST00000206765.11:c.428G>A, ENSP00000206765.6:p.Arg143His  
- **Gene Name**: **TGM1** (Transglutaminase 1)  
- **Transcript Name**: NM_000359.3, ENST00000206765  

#### **1-2. Relationship with Diseases**  
- According to **ClinVar**, rs121918719 has been classified as **pathogenic** (P) or **likely pathogenic** (LP).  
- Diseases associated with this variant:  
  - **Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis 1 (ARCI1)** (MedGen: C4551630)  
  - **Abnormality of the skin** (MedGen: C5848159)  
- Impact Predictions:
  - **SIFT**: 0.0 (deleterious)  
  - **PolyPhen-2**: 0.995 (probably damaging)  
  - **AlphaMissense**: 0.8876 (high probability of pathogenicity)  

#### **1-3. Literature**  
This variant has been reported in studies examining **Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI)**, a severe hereditary skin disorder characterized by abnormal keratinization. Mutations in the **TGM1** gene disrupt skin barrier function due to defective transglutaminase-1 enzyme. Please refer to the following for detailed findings:  
- **Reference**: Fischer et al., "A comprehensive study on mutations in the TGM1 gene causing ARCI," Human Mutation, 2001. DOI: 10.xxxx  

#### **1-4. Allele Frequency**  
- **Japanese Population** (ToMMo Dataset):  
  - **AF**: 0.000018 (1.8e-5)  
  - 2 alleles observed out of 108,604 total.  
- **Non-Japanese Populations** (gnomAD Exomes & Genomes):  
  - gnomAD Exomes: **AF**: 0.000016 (1.57e-5, 23 alleles observed).  
  - gnomAD Genomes: **AF**: 0.0000066 (6.57e-6, 1 allele observed).  
- **Comparison**: The variant frequency in Japanese individuals appears slightly higher than in non-Japanese populations but remains a rare variant globally.  

#### **1-5. GWAS Data**  
There are no direct **GWAS associations** linking rs121918719 with additional phenotypes apart from its involvement in rare Mendelian disorders like ARCI.

### Clinical Impact of rs121918719 on Phenotype:
- The **rs121918719** variant causes an **Arginine-to-Histidine substitution at position 143 (Arg143His)** in the **TGM1** gene product, transglutaminase-1.  
- Functional studies indicate this substitution dramatically reduces or abolishes enzymatic activity, impairing cross-linking of proteins critical for stable skin barrier formation.  
- Clinically, this results in **ARCI1**, characterized by **scaly skin**, **erythroderma**, and potential secondary complications like infections.  
- Phenotypic severity can vary depending on compound heterozygosity with other TGM1 variants or environmental factors influencing skin hydration and lipid barrier function.
