The requested allele frequency data for **rs1170153450** in Japanese populations is not directly available in the provided TogoVar API output or curated datasets. The allele frequency information provided is as follows:

- In gnomAD genomes: Allele frequency (**AF**) = **6.57687 × 10^-6** (across all populations).
- In NCBN: Allele frequency (**AF**) = **4.28046 × 10^-5** (again, no population-specific breakdown for Japanese populations).

There is no specific information in the TogoVar dataset or gnomAD regarding the allele frequency in a uniquely Japanese cohort.
