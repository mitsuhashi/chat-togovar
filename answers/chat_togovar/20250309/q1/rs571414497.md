The allele frequency data for **rs571414497** in Japanese populations is not explicitly provided in the query result obtained from the TogoVar API. Here's a summary of available information:

- **Global Frequencies:**
  - gnomAD Exomes: 8.89 × 10⁻⁶ (count: 13/1,461,892 alleles)
  - gnomAD Genomes: 6.56 × 10⁻⁶ (count: 1/152,338 alleles)
  - NCBN: 4.25 × 10⁻⁵ (count: 1/23,532 alleles)

Since there is no Japanese-specific dataset or annotation present in the available allele frequency data sets, Japanese-specific frequency data cannot be derived from this result.

For further Japanese-specific insights, you may consider examining alternate data sources such as the Japanese Genome Variation Database (JGVD) or other regional genomic databases.
