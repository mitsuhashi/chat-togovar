# ChatGPT Response

The TogoVar API response provided does not specify allele frequencies for Japanese populations. It only includes global frequencies from the gnomAD dataset but does not have specific details for population subsets like Japanese.

For the variant `rs796053166`:

- gnomAD exomes:
  - Allele Count (AC): 9
  - Allele Number (AN): 1,461,778
  - Allele Frequency (AF): ~6.16 × 10⁻⁶
- gnomAD genomes:
  - Allele Count (AC): 1
  - Allele Number (AN): 151,896
  - Allele Frequency (AF): ~6.58 × 10⁻⁶

If data specific to Japanese populations is required, I recommend consulting local genomic databases, such as those for the Japanese population (e.g., ToMMo or jMorp). Unfortunately, this specific data isn't present in the current TogoVar API results.
