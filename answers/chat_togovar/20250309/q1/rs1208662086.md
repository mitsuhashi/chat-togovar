There is no information regarding the allele frequency of the variant "rs1208662086" in Japanese populations based on the data extracted from the TogoVar API. The available allele frequency data is as follows:

- **Global GnomAD Exomes**: Allele frequency = 7.143e-07 (1/1,399,932 alleles)
- **Global GnomAD Genomes**: Allele frequency = 6.57e-06 (1/152,204 alleles)

If specific data on Japanese populations is required, additional sources such as population-specific databases like ToMMo (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization) or JGVD (Japanese Genome Variation Database) should be consulted, as this information is not available in the current dataset.
