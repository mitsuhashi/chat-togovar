# ChatGPT Response

The TogoVar API response does not include allele frequency information specific to Japanese populations for the variant **rs794726721**. Therefore, I currently do not have data to compare allele frequency between Japanese and non-Japanese populations.

You can visit the TogoVar page for this variant for additional details: [TogoVar rs794726721](https://togovar.biosciencedbc.jp/variation/tgv312799719).
