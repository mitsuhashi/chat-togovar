The provided API data does not include allele frequency information specifically for Japanese populations. Reviewing the "frequencies" section in the dataset, allele frequency data is available only in general datasets (e.g., "gnomad_exomes") and not stratified by populations like Japanese or non-Japanese.

For allele-specific frequencies in Japanese populations, databases like TogoVar, JGVD (Japanese Genetic Variation Database), or gnomAD with population-specific filtering would be ideal, but no such data is found in this query.
