Based on the TogoVar API data you provided, the rs762927460 variant is associated with two interpretations in the ClinVar database:

1. **Alternate allele T>A (VCV000805385)**: This variant has a classification of "Uncertain Significance" and is not associated with a reported condition, making it unclear whether it follows a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern.

2. **Alternate allele T>C (VCV000660877)**: This variant is classified as "Likely Pathogenic" and is linked to "Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression bursts." Since SCN1A is involved, the gene is known to have **dominant inheritance patterns** related to early-onset epilepsy. However, functional data specific to this variant would be needed to definitively confirm its mode of action.
