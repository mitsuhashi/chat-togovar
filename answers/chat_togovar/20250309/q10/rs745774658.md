The classification of rs745774658 as a dominant or recessive variant depends on its functional impact and the specific disease context. The following information from the TogoVar API can provide insights:

### Key Points (from the TogoVar data):

1. **Gene Involved:** The variant rs745774658 is located in the **SCN2A** gene, which encodes a sodium channel protein. Variants in SCN2A are often associated with neurological diseases.

2. **Disease Associations:**
   - **Dominant conditions:** This variant is linked to **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, 11** and **Seizures, benign familial infantile, 3**, which are often inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner.
   - **Evidence:** These associations are reported in ClinVar with "Uncertain Significance" (US) interpretations.

3. **Clinical Significance:** ClinVar submissions indicate **uncertain significance** for some conditions, which means the exact inheritance pattern for this variant may not yet be fully established based on the available data.

4. **In Silico Predictions:**
   - Functional impact predictions (SIFT: 0.03, PolyPhen: 0.112, AlphaMissense: 0.0833) suggest a **potential functional effect**, but the scores do not clearly point to a definitive mode of inheritance.

5. **Population Frequency:**
   - The variant has a very low allele frequency in both Japanese and non-Japanese populations, indicating it is rare.
   - A rare variant with such disease connections is more likely to be involved in **dominantly inherited disorders**, as dominant conditions often manifest with single pathogenic variants.

### Conclusion:
While the data supports a dominant inheritance pattern for conditions linked to SCN2A variants like rs745774658, the classification of the variant as "dominant or recessive" might depend on further functional studies or disease-specific evidence.

For specific conditions such as **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy**, SCN2A-related variants are typically treated as **dominant**.
