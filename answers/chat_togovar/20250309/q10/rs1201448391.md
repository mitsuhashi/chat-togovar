The TogoVar API results you provided do not explicitly state whether the rs1201448391 variant is dominant or recessive. Determining the mode of inheritance for a genetic variant, such as whether it is associated with a dominant or recessive trait, requires additional context about the diseases or traits it influences and functional or clinical studies.

### Key Information Retrieved from the TogoVar API:
1. **Variant Details**:
   - rsID: **rs1201448391**
   - Gene: **ALOX12B**
   - Location: Chromosome 17, position 8075595
   - Observed Alleles: **C>A** and **C>G**
   - Most likely consequence: Missense variant.

2. **Clinical and Prediction Tools**:
   - Both **SIFT** and **PolyPhen** scores predict a damaging impact on protein function:
     - **SIFT**: 0.01 (for both C>A and C>G alleles, indicating deleterious)
     - **PolyPhen**: 1.0 (C>A) and up to 0.947 (C>G), indicating probably damaging.
   - **AlphaMissense** scores: ~0.46, suggestive of potential functional impact.

3. **Clinical Significance**:
   - No entries from **ClinVar** regarding established clinical interpretations of dominance or recessiveness.

4. **Population Data**:
   - This variant occurs at very low allele frequencies:
     - For C>A: allele frequency in Japanese population (tommo) is **3.7 × 10⁻⁵**, and in GEM-J WGA, **1.3 × 10⁻⁵**.
     - For C>G: extremely rare, only present in global gnomAD data at **1.4 × 10⁻⁶**.

5. **Gene Function (ALOX12B)**:
   - ALOX12B encodes arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, a protein implicated in skin barrier function. Variants in **ALOX12B** are associated with **autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI)** in other cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the rarity of the rs1201448391 variant, its presence in **ALOX12B** (a gene associated with recessive conditions like ARCI), and the lack of documentation suggesting a dominant mode of inheritance, this variant is more likely to contribute to **recessive conditions** when two deleterious alleles are inherited. However, functional studies or clinical data specific to this variant are needed to confirm this.
