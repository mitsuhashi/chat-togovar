There is no direct information from the TogoVar API or other sources included in this data set specifying whether rs1208662086 is a dominant or recessive variant. The inheritance pattern for a variant often depends on the associated genetic condition and functional studies on genes or their variants, which is typically determined through experimental or clinical literature.

To assess the inheritance pattern (dominant or recessive) of rs1208662086, additional studies, such as linkage analyses, family history evaluations, or functional studies, would be required. For now, no definitive classification is available for this variant regarding its dominance or recessiveness.
