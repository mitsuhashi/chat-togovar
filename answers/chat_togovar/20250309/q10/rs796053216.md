There is no explicit information about whether **rs796053216** is dominant or recessive based on the TogoVar API data provided. However, this variant is associated with the **SCN8A** gene, which has been linked to **Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE)** and other related conditions.

From the curated **ClinVar** data, the variant **rs796053216** is classified as **pathogenic (P)** or **likely pathogenic (LP)** for multiple conditions, including **Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy, type 13 (DEE13)**. DEE13 is known to be caused by **de novo dominant variants** in the **SCN8A** gene. Therefore, it is highly likely that this variant follows a **dominant inheritance pattern**.

For confirmation of inheritance specifics or any potential recessive association, further clinical or genetic evaluations are suggested.
