The variant **rs727504136** affects the **SCN1A** gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, and is linked to disorders such as **severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI)**, also known as **Dravet syndrome**, and other epileptic encephalopathies. These conditions typically follow an **autosomal dominant inheritance pattern**. 

Mutations in the SCN1A gene, including this one, often lead to **haploinsufficiency** (reduced function of one copy of the gene), which is sufficient to cause disease. Therefore, **rs727504136 is consistent with being dominant** based on its association with these autosomal dominant conditions.
