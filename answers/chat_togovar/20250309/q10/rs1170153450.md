The available data for the variant **rs1170153450** through the TogoVar API does not specify whether it is associated with a dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance. Here's what we know about the variant:

1. **Variant Information (1-1):**
   - **rs number**: rs1170153450
   - **Gene name**: ASCL1 and PAH
   - **Transcript name**:
     - ASCL1: ENST00000266744, NM_004316.4 
     - PAH: ENST00000547319, ENST00000551337, NM_001354304.2
   - **HGVS (genomic)**: chr12:g.102958246T>A  

2. **Relationship with Diseases (1-2):**
   - No disease associations or inheritance patterns have been curated in databases like ClinVar for this variant.
   - Predictive tools (SIFT, PolyPhen, AlphaMissense) provide limited insight on its functional impact:
     - **SIFT score**: 0.0, classified as "deleterious."
     - **PolyPhen score**: Unknown.

3. **Association with Disease or Traits in Literature (1-3):**
   - No specific literature mentioning rs1170153450 or any inheritance model is available.

4. **Population Allele Frequencies (1-4):**
   - The variant is rare in global populations:
     - **gnomAD genome dataset**: Allele frequency = 6.58 × 10⁻⁶
     - **ncbn dataset**: Allele frequency = 4.28 × 10⁻⁵

5. **Phenotypes from GWAS Studies (1-5):**
   - No GWAS studies associate this variant with a phenotype.

6. **TogoVar Link (1-6):**

### Conclusion:
Without specific disease or trait associations and no evidence of an inheritance pattern, we cannot classify rs1170153450 as inherently dominant or recessive. Further functional studies or disease segregation analyses are required.
