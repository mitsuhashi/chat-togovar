The available information from TogoVar API indicates that **rs794726784** is associated with **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (SMEI)** and **Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus, type 2**. Both of these conditions are known to be inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner. Variants in the **SCN1A** gene, including **rs794726784**, are often dominant due to their severe effects on protein function, such as creating a premature stop codon.
