The variant **rs796053166** is associated with several conditions, including **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 11 (DEE11)** and **benign familial infantile seizures 3**. These disorders are often inherited in an **autosomal dominant manner**, based on the information available in ClinVar and literature. For example, gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations in the **SCN2A** gene, where this variant is located, have typically been reported in autosomal dominant conditions such as epilepsy or neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Supporting Information:
- **Gene affected**: SCN2A
- **Conditions associated**: DEE11, benign familial infantile seizures 3.
- **ClinVar significance**: Includes pathogenic (P) and likely benign (LB) interpretations.
- **Curated sources**: Conditions mentioned for this variant (related to DEE11, seizure phenotypes) are autosomal dominant.
