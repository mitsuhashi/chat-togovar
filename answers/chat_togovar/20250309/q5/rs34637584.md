The data provided does not indicate information about variants with effects similar to the rs34637584 variant. Let me summarize the details available specifically about rs34637584 and its impact.

### Variant Data for rs34637584 (G>A, chromosome 12, position 40340400):

#### 1-1: Basic Variant Information
- **rs Number:** `rs34637584`
- **Gene Name:** `LRRK2` (Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2)
- **Transcript Names:** Multiple transcripts are affected, including `ENST00000298910` (canonical transcript).
- **HGVS (Human Genome Variation Society) Notation (key examples):**
  - Genomic: `chr12:g.40340400G>A`
  - Transcript: `ENST00000298910.12:c.6055G>A`
  - Protein: `ENSP00000298910.7:p.Gly2019Ser`

#### 1-2: Disease Relevance (ClinVar & Prediction Models)
- **ClinVar Significance:** Associated primarily with Parkinson’s disease (PD):
  - **Pathogenic (P)** or **Likely Pathogenic (LP)** for conditions like "Autosomal dominant Parkinson’s disease 8" and "Parkinson disease, late-onset."
  - Submitted interpretations also mention young-onset PD.
  - **AlphaMissense:** 0.936 (high pathogenicity score)
  - **SIFT Score:** 0.0 (deleterious)
  - **Polyphen-2 Score:** 1.0 (probably damaging)

#### 1-3: Literature Context
- This variant is well known in the scientific community as a causative mutation for Parkinson’s disease. For example, the p.G2019S substitution (widely studied in LRRK2) has been associated in multiple populations with increased PD risk.

#### 1-4: Population Allele Frequencies
- **Japanese Population (Tommo, GEM-J WGA):**
  - Frequency: 0.000028 (extremely rare)
- **Non-Japanese Populations (gnomAD Exomes & Genomes):**
  - Frequency in broader datasets ranges from ~0.00036 to ~0.00042.
  - Higher frequency in European cohorts has been noted in literature.

#### 1-5: GWAS and Related Phenotypes
- Implicated in Parkinson’s-related traits. GWAS studies often highlight `LRRK2` variants, especially p.G2019S, as highly significant markers in PD susceptibility.

#### Variants with Similar Effects (Contextual Information)
Other LRRK2 variants within the same functional domain (the kinase domain, to which p.G2019S belongs) may show similar effects, especially for Parkinson’s disease. These include:
1. **p.R1441C/G/H:** Variants in the ROC domain also linked to familial and sporadic PD.
2. **p.I2020T:** Adjacent to p.G2019S, found in Parkinson's disease patients.
3. **p.Y1699C:** Variant within the COR domain, reported as pathogenic in PD.

Most of these variants cluster around functional domains critical to LRRK2's activity (e.g., ROC, COR, kinase domain) and share biochemical impacts, such as increased kinase activity, which is crucial to PD pathogenesis.
