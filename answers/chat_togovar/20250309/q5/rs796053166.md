From the provided TogoVar API data, there are three known variants at **chromosome 2, position 165,389,450** related to **rs796053166** in the **SCN2A** gene. Here is the breakdown of their effects:

---

### 1. Variant: **C → A (rs796053166)**
- **Gene and transcript information:**  
  Gene: **SCN2A**  
  Transcripts: Multiple (e.g., ENST00000283256, ENST00000375437, etc.)
  - **HGVS (c):** ENST00000283256.10:c.5644C>A  
  - **HGVS (p):** ENSP00000283256.6:p.Arg1882= (synonymous variant)

- **Effect**:  
  This variant is a **synonymous substitution** (most severe consequence: **SO_0001819**) and does not change the amino acid (Arg1882). It has a relatively **low clinical significance**, marked as "likely benign (LB)" in **ClinVar**.

- **Frequencies:**  
  Observed in **gnomAD exomes (AF: ~6.15 × 10^-6)** and **gnomAD genomes (AF: ~6.58 × 10^-6)**. No population-specific details are provided.

- **Clinical associations:**  
  Two conditions mentioned:
  - **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, 11**  
  - **Benign familial infantile seizures, 3**  
  However, the variant is predominantly considered not pathogenic.

- **Prediction tools:**  
  No predictions (e.g., SIFT, PolyPhen, AlphaMissense) indicate this variant has functional effects.

### 2. Variant: **C → G (rs796053166)**
- **Gene and transcript information:**  
  Gene: **SCN2A**  
  Transcripts: Multiple (e.g., ENST00000283256, ENST00000375437, etc.)
  - **HGVS (c):** ENST00000283256.10:c.5644C>G  
  - **HGVS (p):** ENSP00000283256.6:p.Arg1882Gly (missense change)

- **Effect:**  
  This variant is a **missense mutation** changing the amino acid at position 1882 from **arginine (Arg)** to **glycine (Gly)** (*SO_0001583*). It likely leads to functional disturbance in the protein. Prediction tools signal potential deleterious effects:
  - **SIFT:** Score = 0.0 (*deleterious*)
  - **AlphaMissense:** Confidence = 0.8635
  - **PolyPhen:** Data unavailable.

- **Clinical associations:**  
  Strongly linked to multiple conditions with **pathogenic (P)** significance:  
  - **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, 11**  
  - **Benign familial infantile seizures, 3**
  - **Episodic ataxia, type 9**

- **Frequencies:**  
  Not observed in any global population database, suggesting rarity.

### 3. Variant: **C → T (rs796053166)**
- **Gene and transcript information:**  
  Gene: **SCN2A**  
  Transcripts: Multiple (e.g., ENST00000283256, ENST00000375437, etc.)  
  - **HGVS (c):** ENST00000283256.10:c.5644C>T  
  - **HGVS (p):** ENSP00000283256.6:p.Arg1882Ter (nonsense mutation)

- **Effect:**  
  This variant creates a **stop codon** at position 1882 (*SO_0001587*), truncating the protein. Such changes often result in **loss-of-function** of the **SCN2A protein**.  
  Functional predictions are not available for this variant.

- **Clinical associations:**  
  This variant is reported as:
  - **Pathogenic (P)** in **developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, 11**.
  - **Likely pathogenic (LP)** for some **inborn genetic diseases**.

- **Frequencies:**  
  Not observed in any population databases, highlighting its rarity.

### Summary of Similar Variants:
- The **C → A** variant results in no amino acid change and is likely benign.
- The **C → G** and **C → T** variants are associated with severe clinical outcomes.  
  - The **C → G** variant shows **missense effects** (e.g., Arg → Gly).  
  - The **C → T** variant creates a **premature stop codon**, leading to potential loss of function.  

**Note:** These variants are within the same gene and likely contribute to different severities of SCN2A-related conditions.
