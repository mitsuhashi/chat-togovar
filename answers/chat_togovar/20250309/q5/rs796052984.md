### **Other Variants in SCN1A with Similar Effects**
Mutations in the SCN1A gene are often associated with epilepsy syndromes, particularly Dravet syndrome and other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies. Variants causing amino acid substitutions at conserved domains in SCN1A's critical regions (e.g., sodium channel domains) have similar effects:

1. **c.2689G>C (p.Gly897Arg)**:
   - SIFT: 0.0 (damaging)  
   - PolyPhen-2: 0.966 (probably damaging).

2. **c.2638G>C (p.Gly880Arg)**:
   - SIFT: 0.0 (damaging)  
   - PolyPhen-2: 0.980 (probably damaging).

3. **c.2638G>A (p.Gly880Ser)**:
   - SIFT: 0.0 (damaging)  
   - PolyPhen-2: 0.930 (probably damaging).

4. **c.2686G>A (p.Gly896Arg)**:
   - SIFT: 0.0 (damaging)
   - PolyPhen-2: 0.961 (probably damaging).

### Summary of Similar Effects
- Variants like **p.Gly908Arg** (rs796052984, C>G) and **p.Gly908Ser** (rs796052984, C>T) share a high impact on SCN1A, disrupting the sodium channel.
- Other substitutions in close residues (e.g., Gly897, Gly880) have similar pathogenic predictions using SIFT, PolyPhen, and AlphaMissense functional tools. These are likely pathogenic or damaging due to their critical roles in channel activity.
