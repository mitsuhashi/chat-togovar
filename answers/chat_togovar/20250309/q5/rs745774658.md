The rs745774658 variant in the SCN2A gene is associated with phenotypic effects and potential health conditions. Hereâ€™s the detailed analysis and related information:

1. **Link Information** (1-1):
   - **rs number**: [rs745774658](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs745774658)
   - **Gene Name**: SCN2A
   - **Transcript Name**: ENST00000283256 (and multiple others)
   - **HGVS**: chr2:g.165315486G>A (example for one substitution)

2. **Disease Associations** (1-2):
   - Variants in the SCN2A gene that mimic rs745774658 in terms of effect often lead to neurological conditions such as **Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 11 (DEE11)** and **Benign Familial Infantile Seizures 3 (BFIS3)**.
   - **ClinVar Status**: rs745774658 has been linked to uncertain significance (US) and conflicts in pathogenicity. Specific variants, such as c.1399G>A (p.Ala467Thr) in SCN2A, are known to disrupt sodium channel function in neurons, leading to these disorders.
   - **Predictive Scores** for rs745774658:
     - SIFT: 0.03 (deleterious)
     - Polyphen: 0.112 (probably benign)
     - AlphaMissense: 0.0833 (functional impact to some extent)

3. **Literature Evidence** (1-3):
   - Literature referencing SCN2A variants often highlights their role in sodium channel function critical for neuronal excitability. Variants affecting such channels are implicated in epilepsy and other neurological disorders, particularly in early development. However, no unique studies were provided in the dataset for rs745774658.

4. **Population Frequency** (1-4):
   - In **Japanese populations**:
     - The allele frequency in the Tohoku Medical Megabank (ToMMo) database is 0.0001009.
   - In **Global populations** (gnomAD):
     - Exomes: 0.0000171
     - Genomes: 0.0000328
   - Notably, this variant shows slightly higher representation in certain population subsets, indicating potential population-specific occurrence or founder effects.

5. **Phenotype from GWAS and ClinVar** (1-5):
   - Phenotypes associated with SCN2A variants like rs745774658 often range from **seizures** to cognitive impairment. Rs745774658 specifically has been linked to developmental neurological states and benign conditions.

6. **Similar Variants**:
   Other SCN2A variants related to sodium-channel dysfunction and overlapping phenotypes include:
   - **c.3641G>C (p.Gly1214Arg)**: Associated with DEE and impaired channel inactivation.
   - **c.5302A>G (p.Asn1768Ser)**: Seen in DEE11.
   - **rs121908466** (c.7041G>A, p.Arg2347Gln): Associated with epilepsy (ClinVar).
