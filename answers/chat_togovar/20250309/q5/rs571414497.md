### 2. **Relationship with Diseases (1-2):**
   - **Disease Associations:**
     According to data in ClinVar, this variant is labeled as having *no clinical significance* (significance=NC). No links to specific diseases have been confirmed.  
   - **Predictions:**
     - SIFT = 1.0 (tolerated)
     - PolyPhen = 0.02 (benign)
     - AlphaMissense = 0.1493 (low pathogenicity)

   These computational insights suggest that the variant is likely benign and has minimal functional impact.

### 4. **Population Comparison (1-4):**
   - **Allele Frequency:**
     - GnomAD Exomes: 0.000009 (9 alleles in 1,461,892 total observed alleles)
     - GnomAD Genomes: 0.0000065 (1 allele in 152,338 total observed alleles)
     - **Japanese Subset:** Specific frequency data not available.
   - The low global frequency suggests that this is a rare variant. There is insufficient data to provide a meaningful population comparison, especially for Japanese versus non-Japanese populations.

### Variants with Similar Effects:
The data from computational tools (SIFT, PolyPhen, and AlphaMissense) can provide clues. Variants in the **ALOXE3 gene** with:
   - Missense nature
   - Tolerance in SIFT (score ~1)
   - Benign predictions in PolyPhen (score <0.1)
   - AlphaMissense pathogenicity score near or below 0.15

â€¦ may share similar effects, assuming no evidence of pathogenicity is linked to these variants.

To identify such variants specifically, additional exploration of databases like **ClinVar**, **dbSNP**, or **gnomAD** would be required.
