Based on the TogoVar API results for rs1201448391, here is information about variants with similar effects:

### rs1201448391 Overview
1. **Gene Name**: ALOX12B
2. **Transcript(s) and Annotation**:
   - Major transcripts impacted:
     - `ENST00000647874` with `HGVS_p: Gly552Cys (C>A)` and `Gly552Arg (C>G)`
     - `ENST00000649809` with `HGVS_p: Gly240Cys (C>A)` and `Gly240Arg (C>G)`
   - Most severe consequence: Missense variant (SO_0001583)
3. **Pathogenicity Predictions**:
   - **SIFT**: Scores for both alternate alleles (`C>A`, `C>G`) suggest deleterious effects (SIFT score: 0.01 for C>A; 0.0 for C>G).
   - **PolyPhen**: Scores for both alternate alleles indicate damaging predictions (PolyPhen score ~0.999–1.0).
   - **AlphaMissense**: Moderate pathogenicity prediction (score: ~0.46 for both alleles).

### Related Variants:
While specific variants similar to rs1201448391 were not directly queried in the API, below are generic ways to identify similar effects:
1. **Same Gene (ALOX12B)**:
   - Variants leading to missense mutations in critical residues like glycine (Gly) or conserved regions of the ALOX12B gene may have functional effects similar to rs1201448391.

2. **Predicted Pathogenic Variants**:
   - Variants in other genes with:
     - **SIFT scores** near or at 0 (deleterious)
     - **PolyPhen scores** >0.9 (likely damaging)
     - Moderate to high **AlphaMissense** predictions (≥0.4)

3. **Reported Variants in Databases**:
   - Searching for variants in the ALOX12B gene with `SO_0001583 (missense variant)` or focusing specifically on Glyine replacements (e.g., at codons 240 or 552).
