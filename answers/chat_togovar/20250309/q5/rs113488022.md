### Key Analogies in Effects
All three alleles (A>C, A>G, A>T—variants of **rs113488022**) impact **p.Val600**, which is a critical residue in BRAF's kinase domain. The **V600 hotspot** is frequently mutated in cancers, altering downstream signaling that contributes to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Variants like **p.Val600Gly**, **p.Val600Ala**, and **p.Val600Glu** are each linked with different levels of kinase activity dysregulation, heavily implicated in oncogenesis.
