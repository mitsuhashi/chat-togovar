The variant **rs1235072590** does not have any information available in the TogoVar API based on the query results you provided. However, I can help generate relevant information based on ChatGPT knowledge up to October 2023. Let's address points 1-1 to 1-6 systematically for this or similar variants, where applicable:

---

### 1-1. Variant Details
There is no detailed data available for rs1235072590 in the query results. However, based on the structure of rs numbers and typical genomic databases, this would correspond to a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) recorded in dbSNP. If you provide the HGVS name, gene name, or transcript for rs1235072590, I can explore further.

### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases
Without curated data from ClinVar, AlphaMissense, SIFT, or PolyPhen, the association of rs1235072590 with diseases cannot be confirmed. However, similar variants to rs1235072590 (e.g., other variants within a specific critical gene implicated in diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disorders, etc.) might impact protein function or splicing efficiency, as predicted via such tools. 

Examples:
- **SIFT**: Predicts whether a variant affects protein function based on sequence conservation.
- **PolyPhen**: Predicts the impact of amino acid changes on protein stability and function.

You may access ClinVar or use prediction models for analysis or to find variants with similar disease effects.

### 1-3. Literature Evidence
There is no direct information on rs1235072590 in the TogoVar API or additional literature referenced. Variants known to affect similar genomic loci should be reviewed by searching PubMed to gather research relevant to nearby genes/transcripts that may be functionally or phenotypically similar.

### 1-4. Allele Frequency in Populations
Information on allele frequencies specifically for rs1235072590 is unavailable based on your query. For similar SNPs, differences are often observed based on population-specific selection (e.g., Japanese vs. non-Japanese). For example:
- Some variants linked to pharmacogenomics (e.g., in CYP2D6 or HLA genes) show higher frequencies in East Asian populations compared to Caucasians, affecting medical treatments.
