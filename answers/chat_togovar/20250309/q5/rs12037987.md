### 1-3. Literature Evidence:

No specific literature linking rs12037987 to diseases, phenotypes, or functional impacts is available in the TogoVar API dataset.

---

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies Across Populations:

- **Japanese Populations**:
  - **ToMMo (jMorp)**: Frequency = 29.27%  
  - **GEM-J WGA**: Frequency = 29.90%  
  - **JGA (WGS)**: Frequency = 39.10%  
  - **JGA (WES)**: Frequency = 3.99% (Notable for low value)*

- **Non-Japanese Populations**:
  - **gnomAD Genomes (all populations)**: Frequency = 8.89%  

**Observation**:  
This variant is much more frequent in Japanese populations compared to non-Japanese populations, as evidenced by data from sources such as ToMMo, GEM-J, and JGA. This suggests potential ethnic-specific variation specific to Japanese or East Asian ancestry.
