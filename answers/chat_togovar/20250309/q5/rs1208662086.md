The rs1208662086 variant is located within the **SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1) gene** at chromosome 5, position 179820940. Based on the provided dataset and its interpretation, rs1208662086 primarily has a missense consequence (SO_0001583), leading to an amino acid substitution in several transcripts (e.g., **p.Ala2Ser**). Since you are interested in similar variants with effects akin to rs1208662086, here’s the information compiled from the TogoVar API output:

### 1-1. Data Overview for rs1208662086:

### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases:
- **Curated Information:** The TogoVar API output does not specify explicit disease associations in ClinVar (NC: No clinical significance reported).  
- **Predictions:**
  - **SIFT:** 0.05 (deleterious)
  - **Polyphen:** Ranges from 0.119 to 0.969 across transcripts (probably damaging in some cases).
  - **AlphaMissense:** 0.0947 (low pathogenicity score).

Variants with a similar effect would likely share these pathogenicity predictions (deleterious on SIFT or damaging on PolyPhen).

### 1-5. GWAS and Phenotypes:
No GWAS results explicitly associate phenotypes with rs1208662086. However, variants in the **SQSTM1 gene** are critically implicated in diseases like **Paget's disease of bone** and **amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)**. Other missense variants affecting critical residues in SQSTM1, such as those in its ubiquitin-binding or zinc-finger domains, may have similar effects.

### Approach to Identifying Similar Variants:
To find variants with similar effects, consider:
1. **Other missense variants in the SQSTM1 gene**:
   - Example: Variants leading to protein changes in functionally critical regions such as the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) or PB1 domain.
2. **Variants with similar pathogenicity scores** for SIFT/PolyPhen in the same or related genes (e.g., involved in autophagy or stress response). 
   - Search TogoVar or ClinVar for similar deleterious predictions.
3. **Variants impacting the same amino acid in different populations** (e.g., different alleles at position c.4G>T).

If you have specific criteria for locating these, databases like **gnomAD**, **ClinVar**, or additional TogoVar queries can provide such comparisons.

#### Example of another SQSTM1 missense variant:
   - **rs116889818 (SQSTM1 p.Ala390Thr):** Associated with Paget’s disease and classified as likely pathogenic.
