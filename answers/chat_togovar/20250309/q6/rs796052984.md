The variant **rs796052984** is located in the **SCN1A** gene, which encodes the sodium channel protein Nav1.1. Variants in SCN1A are primarily associated with neurological conditions, such as epilepsy, and are not directly linked to drug metabolism pathways. However, SCN1A variants can influence drug response, particularly in the context of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

### Key Information:
1. **Variant Identification**:
   - **rs number**: [rs796052984](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs796052984)
   - **Gene**: SCN1A
   - **HGVS Notation**: Multiple transcript-specific notations are available, such as:
     - **NM_001165963.4:c.2722G>C** (p.Gly908Arg)
     - **NM_001165963.4:c.2722G>A** (p.Gly908Ser)
   - **TogoVar Link**: [TogoVar rs796052984](https://togovar.biosciencedbc.jp/variant/tgv312799720)

2. **Drug Response**:
   - Variants in **SCN1A** are known to influence the efficacy and tolerability of certain antiepileptic drugs, such as **phenytoin** and **carbamazepine**. These drugs target sodium channels, and changes in SCN1A can alter their binding or effectiveness.
   - While **rs796052984** specifically has not been directly linked to drug metabolism or response in the retrieved data, its predicted pathogenicity (e.g., **PolyPhen = 0.999**, **SIFT = 0.0**) suggests it could have functional consequences on the SCN1A protein, potentially affecting drug response.

3. **Disease Associations**:
   - This variant has been associated with **early infantile epileptic encephalopathy** and other neurological conditions, which often require treatment with sodium channel blockers or other AEDs.

4. **Predictive Models**:
   - **SIFT**: 0.0 (deleterious)
   - **PolyPhen**: 0.999 (probably damaging)
   - **AlphaMissense**: 0.9997 (high pathogenicity)

5. **Population Frequency**:
   - The variant is extremely rare, with an allele frequency of **7.5e-06** in gnomAD exomes, suggesting it is unlikely to be a common pharmacogenomic marker.

### Conclusion:
While **rs796052984** has not been explicitly linked to drug metabolism or response in the available data, its location in the **SCN1A** gene and its predicted pathogenicity suggest it could influence the response to sodium channel-targeting drugs, such as phenytoin or carbamazepine. Further functional studies or clinical pharmacogenomic data would be needed to confirm its role in drug response.
