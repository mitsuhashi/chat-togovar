There is no direct information available from the TogoVar API or other sources in the provided data indicating that rs12037987 influences drug metabolism or response. Below is a summary of the available information:

### 1-1. Variant Information
- **rs number**: rs12037987
- **HGVS**: Multiple notations, including `chr1:g.112500200T>C`
- **Gene name**: WNT2B
- **Transcript name**: ENST00000256640, ENST00000369686, NM_001291880.1, NM_004185.4

### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases
- No curated disease associations or functional predictions (e.g., AlphaMissense, SIFT, PolyPhen) are available for this variant.

### 1-3. Literature Evidence
- No specific literature linking rs12037987 to drug metabolism or response was found in the provided data.

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies
- The allele frequencies vary across populations:
  - **Japanese populations**: Higher frequencies (e.g., 0.2927 in ToMMo, 0.299 in GEM-J WGA)
  - **Non-Japanese populations**: Lower frequency (e.g., 0.0889 in gnomAD Genomes)
  - This suggests potential population-specific differences, but no direct link to drug metabolism is evident.

### 1-5. GWAS Results
- No GWAS results or phenotypes related to drug metabolism or response are mentioned for this variant.

### 1-6. TogoVar Link
