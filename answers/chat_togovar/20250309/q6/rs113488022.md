There is no direct information from the TogoVar API or the provided dataset indicating that rs113488022 influences drug metabolism or response. The variant is associated with the **BRAF** gene, which is primarily implicated in cancer-related pathways and diseases such as melanoma, colorectal cancer, and others. However, BRAF mutations, particularly the well-known V600E mutation, are often studied in the context of targeted therapies (e.g., BRAF inhibitors like vemurafenib or dabrafenib) for cancer treatment. 

If you are interested in a specific drug or therapeutic context, further literature review or database searches (e.g., PharmGKB or DrugBank) may be required to determine any potential influence of rs113488022 on drug metabolism or response.
