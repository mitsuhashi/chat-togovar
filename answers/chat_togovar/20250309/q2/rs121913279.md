The rs121913279 variant is located in the **PIK3CA** gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit p110α of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K). This variant has two alternate alleles: **A>G** and **A>T**, which lead to different amino acid substitutions at the same position of the protein.

### 1. Gene and Protein Details (1-1)
- **rs number:** rs121913279
- **Gene:** PIK3CA
- **Transcript:** ENST00000263967
- **HGVS notations:** 
  - For A>G: c.3140A>G (p.His1047Arg)
  - For A>T: c.3140A>T (p.His1047Leu)

### 2. Predicted Impact on Function (1-2)
The variant causes changes in the PIK3CA protein at position 1047, which is located within the kinase domain of p110α and is critical for its enzymatic activity. Here are computational predictions for both variants:
- **A>G (p.His1047Arg):**
  - **SIFT:** 0.0 (damaging)
  - **PolyPhen-2:** 0.088 (possibly benign)
  - **AlphaMissense:** 0.5381 (intermediate level of pathogenicity)

- **A>T (p.His1047Leu):**
  - **SIFT:** 0.07 (damaging)
  - **PolyPhen-2:** 0.007 (probably benign)
  - **AlphaMissense:** 0.438 (intermediate level of pathogenicity)

Overall, these tools suggest a potential effect on protein function, with particularly strong support for the **p.His1047Arg** substitution being functionally impactful.

### 3. Known Disease Associations (1-2)
The rs121913279 variant has been implicated in multiple diseases involving the **PI3K/AKT pathway**, notably:
- **Cancer:** Associated with various malignancies such as breast, ovarian, colon, and lung cancers, among others. 
- **Overgrowth Syndromes:** PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS), including CLOVES syndrome and conditions like macrodactyly.
- **Others:** Conditions such as megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria syndrome.

The pathogenicity level in ClinVar is commonly marked as **"Pathogenic (P)"** or **"Likely Pathogenic (LP)"** for these alleles, given their cancer-driving roles.

### 4. Structural and Functional Effects
- **Mechanism of Action:** The His1047Arg/Leu substitutions occur in the kinase domain, altering its activity:
  - Increased catalytic activity of PI3K.
  - Constitutive activation of downstream signaling in the **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway**, which is critical for cell growth, survival, and proliferation.
- **Oncogenic Role:** These mutations lead to uncontrolled cell cycle progression and resistance to apoptosis, driving tumorigenesis.

### Summary
The rs121913279 variant, through alterations of a critical kinase residue (His1047), disrupts the normal function of PI3K, leading to enhanced kinase activity and downstream signaling. These functional changes underpin its strong association with cancers and developmental disorders, rendering it a well-characterized oncogenic and pathogenic mutation.
