#### 1-3. **Literature**:
Although the TogoVar API does not directly provide referenced literature, variants in **SCN1A** are widely studied due to their association with epilepsy syndromes, particularly **Dravet Syndrome**. Variants such as p.Val422Leu and p.Val422Met are located in the sodium channel protein type 1 subunit alpha (Nav1.1), which affects neuronal excitability.

Further literature search may yield studies focusing on these mutations' roles in altering the biophysical properties of sodium channels and their impact on GABAergic neurons.

#### 1-4. **Allele Frequencies**:
No population-specific allele frequency data (e.g., Japanese vs. non-Japanese cohorts) is listed in the TogoVar results for **rs886042528**.

---

#### 1-5. **GWAS Results and Related Phenotypes**:
No direct GWAS results for rs886042528 are listed. However, since the variant is located in the **SCN1A** gene, which is widely studied for epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders, it may potentially emerge in studies of these phenotypes.

#### Summary:
The rs886042528 variant, particularly missense alterations such as p.Val422Leu and p.Val422Met in the **SCN1A** gene, is predicted to have a damaging effect on sodium channel function. The disruption in channel activity leads to hyperexcitability in neurons, significantly contributing to epileptic and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as **Dravet Syndrome** and **DEE6B**. Additional studies to understand the clinical and biophysical effects are critical.
