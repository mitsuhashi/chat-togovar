### 1-3. Structural and Functional Effects
- **Protein Structure Impact**: The substitutions at critical valine residue positions (such as p.Val600) occur within the kinase domain of BRAF. This domain is crucial for signal transduction via phosphorylation in the MAPK pathway. Modifications at these positions:
  - Lead to **gain-of-function mutations**, which increase kinase activity and constitutively activate the pathway.
  - Such activity is linked to oncogenic transformation, unchecked cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis.

- **Literature Evidence**:
  - Studies specifically highlight p.Val600Glu (commonly referred to as BRAF V600E), one of the most frequent mutations in cancer biology, as a driver of tumors such as melanoma and colorectal cancer.
