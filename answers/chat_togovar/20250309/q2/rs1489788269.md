- **HGVS nomenclature**:
  - Genomic: `chr17:g.8111519T>C`
  - Transcript-level (e.g., ENST00000318227): `c.797A>G`
  - Protein: `p.Glu266Gly` (substitution of Glutamic acid (Glu) with Glycine (Gly) at position 266)
- **Gene name**: ALOXE3
- **Transcript name**: ENST00000318227 (and others)

#### 1-2: **Relationship with Gene Function and Diseases**
- **Impact Prediction**:
  - SIFT: 0.0 (Damaging)
  - PolyPhen-2: 0.682 (Possibly damaging)
  - AlphaMissense: 0.1232 (Unlikely to be deleterious)
- **ClinVar**:
  - Classified as "Uncertain Significance" (US)
  - Associated with inborn genetic diseases (MedGen: [C0950123](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0950123))

The substitution (`p.Glu266Gly`) occurs in the gene ALOXE3, which is involved in lipid metabolism pathways, particularly in skin barrier function and epidermal differentiation. The altered amino acid may impair enzymatic activity due to its location within the functional domain of the protein, potentially affecting lipid oxygenation activity.

#### 1-3: **Literature**
No specific studies directly associated with rs1489788269 were found in the referenced data sources.

#### 1-4: **Population Allele Frequencies**
- **Non-Japanese Populations**:
  - Frequency in gnomAD exomes: `0.0000041` (4.1 per million alleles)
  - Frequency in gnomAD genomes: `0.0000066`
- **Japanese Populations**:
  - No distinct frequency data provided, likely very rare.
  
The variantâ€™s rarity in broader populations suggests a limited functional impact or low penetrance in relation to diseases.

#### 1-5: **GWAS Results**
No phenotypes associated with rs1489788269 have been reported in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

### Structural and Functional Impact on ALOXE3:
1. **Structural Impact**:
   - **Protein Domain**: Glutamic acid (Glu) at position 266 lies within a functionally important region of the ALOXE3 protein. Its replacement by glycine (Gly) may alter local protein folding and stability due to the non-polar nature of glycine compared to Glutamic acid's negatively charged side chain.

2. **Functional Impact**:
   - ALOXE3 encodes an essential enzyme in epidermal lipid metabolism. The mutation may diminish or disrupt its oxygenase activity, potentially impairing skin barrier functionality.
   - Predictive tools (PolyPhen, SIFT) suggest a potentially deleterious effect, though AlphaMissense indicates a low probability of severe functional consequences.

### Summary:
rs1489788269 (`p.Glu266Gly`) in the ALOXE3 gene appears to have a variable impact on protein function. Computational predictions suggest it may be damaging, particularly in pathways related to skin physiology and lipid metabolism. However, its clinical significance is not yet well-established, highlighting the need for further functional and population-specific studies.
