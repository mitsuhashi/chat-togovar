### **3. Literature Mentions**
No specific literature data is extracted from the API for rs796053166. However, SCN2A mutations, especially missense and nonsense variants, are strongly linked with neurological disorders, suggesting the importance of this gene in brain function. Further literature search is recommended for detailed experimental studies.

### **4. Population Allele Frequencies (Japanese vs Non-Japanese)**
Population-specific allele frequency data is available only for the **C>A** variant:
- **C>A (Synonymous)**:
  - **Global allele frequency in gnomAD (Exomes)**: ~6.16 Ã— 10^-6.
  - No allele frequencies specific to Japanese or non-Japanese populations have been reported.

Frequencies for **C>G** and **C>T** variants are not available, indicating these pathogenic variants are highly rare.

### **Summary of Impact on Structure and Function**
- The **C>A** variation (synonymous) is expected to have no functional impact on the SCN2A gene/protein structure.
- The **C>G** variant leads to an amino acid substitution (Arg1882Gly), altering protein structure/function, resulting in severe neurological conditions.
- The **C>T** variant introduces a premature stop codon (p.Arg1882Ter), likely abolishing the protein's function and is associated with severe epilepsy syndromes.

For additional insights or functional studies, further experimental data and literature review are necessary.
