### Information on rs763684724 Impact:

1. **Link Information (rs number, HGVS, Gene, Transcript) [1-1]:**
   - **RS Number:** [rs763684724](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs763684724)
   - **Gene Name:** SCN1B (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Beta Subunit 1)
   - **Transcripts Affected:** Multiple, including `ENST00000415950` and `NM_199037.5`
     - **HGVS (Protein):** p.Pro199Ser (NM_199037.5:c.595C>T)
     - **HGVS (Genomic):** chr19:g.35033886C>T

2. **Relationship with Diseases [1-2]:**
   - **ClinVar:** No curated disease association is noted for rs763684724.
   - **Prediction Tools:**
     - **AlphaMissense:** No pathogenicity score reported.
     - **SIFT:** Score = 0.06 (interpreted as "possibly damaging").
     - **PolyPhen:** Score = 0.108 (interpreted as "benign").
   - Based on these computational predictions, the functional impact on protein coding and disease is likely to be mild and possibly not pathogenic.

3. **Structural and Functional Impact:**
   - **Protein Variant:** p.Pro199Ser (Proline to Serine substitution) in SCN1B protein:
     - SCN1B encodes the beta subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel, critical for neuronal excitability.
     - Substitution of Proline (non-polar) with Serine (polar) could cause minimal conformational changes in the protein but does not strongly disrupt structure or function based on prediction tools.

4. **Allele Frequencies [1-4]:**
   - The allele frequency in global populations (gnomAD):
     - **Exomes:** 1.38e-6 (2 alleles out of 1,445,174; very rare)
     - **Genomes:** 6.57e-6 (1 allele out of 152,112; very rare)
   - No specific data for Japanese or other ethnic groups were reported, but the variant's occurrence is exceedingly rare across populations.

5. **GWAS Phenotypes [1-5]:**
   - The variant rs763684724 is not reported in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for any related phenotypes.

6. **TogoVar Link [1-6]:**

### Conclusion:
The rs763684724 allele causes a rare missense variant in the SCN1B gene, resulting in a Proline-to-Serine substitution in the SCN1B protein. Prediction tools indicate a minimal impact on protein function, and no direct associations with diseases or phenotypes have been identified in clinical or GWAS datasets.
