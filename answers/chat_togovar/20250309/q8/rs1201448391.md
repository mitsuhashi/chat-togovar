There is no information regarding the impact of rs1201448391 on transcript expression based on the provided TogoVar API dataset or alternate sources. The dataset primarily provides details on the genetic variant, its consequence annotations, allele frequencies, and pathogenicity predictions but does not include data on transcript expression changes caused by the variant. 

For further exploration, studies specifically focusing on the *ALOX12B* gene and its variants' effects on expression may provide more insights.
