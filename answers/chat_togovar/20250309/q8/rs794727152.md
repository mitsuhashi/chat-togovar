There is no direct information about how the rs794727152 variant affects transcript expression in the data retrieved from the TogoVar API. This variant is associated with the **SCN2A** gene (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 2) and is commonly categorized as having clinical significance due to its relationship with **neurological conditions** such as **developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 11** and other related diseases. However, its impact on transcript expression, such as changes in RNA stability or alternative splicing, is not discussed in the provided dataset.

If you're interested in its functional impact, studies using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in patient-derived tissues or experimental validation with reporter assays might be required for a precise answer.

For additional information, you can refer to the variantâ€™s record on databases like ClinVar or TogoVar:
