Based on the TogoVar API data, there is no explicit information provided regarding how the variant **rs794726721** directly affects transcript expression. The available data primarily focuses on its genomic consequences, associated diseases, and pathogenic predictions.

The variant affects the **SCN1A** gene, which plays a significant role in encoding a voltage-gated sodium channel. For the nucleotide changes observed (**G>A** and **G>T**), the most severe consequences are:

1. **G>A**:
   - This change results in a nonsense mutation (p.Gln910Ter in some transcripts), leading to a truncated, likely non-functional protein. Such a mutation could decrease expression of functional transcripts through nonsense-mediated decay.

2. **G>T**:
   - A missense mutation (e.g., p.Gln910Lys in some transcripts) is predicted to severely impair the function of the encoded protein. While no explicit expression data is provided, such a mutation could indirectly affect transcript levels due to functional degradation mechanisms.

Due to the lack of detailed transcript expression data, further experiments or literature reviews are needed to assess specific effects.
