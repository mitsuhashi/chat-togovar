No evidence or directly curated information about rs704341's effect on transcript expression is available in the provided TogoVar API search results or other linked resources. However, here is the data analysis based on the API results:

### 1-1. **Variant Information:**
- **rs Number:** [rs704341](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs704341)
- **Gene Name:** *PTPRG* (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type G)
- **HGVS:**
  - Genomic: `chr3:g.61963062G>A`
  - Related Transcripts:
    - `ENST00000295874.14:c.191-26563G>A`
    - `ENST00000474889.6:c.191-26563G>A`
    - `NM_001375471.1:c.191-26563G>A`
    - `NM_002841.4:c.191-26563G>A`
    - Various others listed in the API result.

### 1-2. **Relationship to Disease and Predictions:**
No robust evidence from ClinVar or other prediction tools like SIFT, PolyPhen-2, or AlphaMissense was provided regarding whether rs704341 impacts disease or biological functions significantly.

### 1-3. **Literature Information:**
There is no explicit mention in the provided API results or referenced literature regarding the impact of rs704341 on transcript expression.

### 1-4. **Population Allele Frequencies:**
- Japanese population (ToMMo): 1.6% frequency (0.0158)
- Global populations (gnomAD Genomes): 11.19% frequency (0.1119)

This significant difference in allele frequency suggests that the variant distribution varies across populations, but this difference does not automatically indicate an effect on transcript expression.

### 1-5. **GWAS Results and Related Phenotypes:**
No GWAS associations or phenotypes linked to rs704341 were specified in the TogoVar results.

### 1-6. **TogoVar Link:**
Details and annotations for rs704341 can be reviewed further on the [TogoVar page](https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/search?query=3%3A61963062).

Unfortunately, without functional studies specifically addressing rs704341's effect on *PTPRG* transcript expression, no conclusions can be drawn about its impact. Further experimental research, such as RNA-Seq analysis or qPCR studies, would be needed to determine whether this variant affects transcript expression.
