There is no information available in the TogoVar API for the variant rs1235072590, as indicated by the returned data being empty. Below is a summary based on ChatGPT:

Currently, no specific data directly links rs1235072590 to its influence on transcript expression. However, to explore how this SNP might affect gene regulation or transcript levels, additional research and functional studies (e.g., quantitative PCR, RNA-Seq, or eQTL mapping) would be necessary. Variations such as rs1235072590 can potentially affect gene expression if they occur in regulatory regions like promoters, enhancers, or intronic regions that influence splicing.

For further details or to corroborate this tentative interpretation, consider consulting genomic databases like ClinVar or research more about this variant through related transcript studies.
