# ChatTogoVar

The TogoVar data provided does not contain information about how the rs121913529 variant directly affects transcript expression. It provides details on the association with diseases, amino acid changes (like p.Gly12Val, p.Gly12Asp, and p.Gly12Ala), and functional predictions based on tools such as SIFT, Polyphen, and AlphaMissense. However, transcript-level expression changes due to rs121913529 are not reported here.

For more information, you may explore experimental studies or transcriptomic analyses specifically investigating this variant.
