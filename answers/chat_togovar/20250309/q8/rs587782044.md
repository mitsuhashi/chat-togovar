There is no direct information available in the data about how rs587782044 affects transcript expression. The data provided includes information on the variants' genomic annotations, disease associations, and computational predictions but no experimental evidence or mechanisms related to transcript expression levels.

However, rs587782044 is associated with the **CDH1** gene, which plays a critical role in cell adhesion and tumor suppression. Variants in this gene, such as missense mutations, could potentially impact gene function or regulation indirectly, but there is no explicit evidence here linking this specific variant to changes in transcript expression.

For more detailed experimental insights, additional literature searches or RNA expression studies targeting this variant would be necessary.
