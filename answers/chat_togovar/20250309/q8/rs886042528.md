I could not find relevant transcript expression information for rs886042528 directly from the provided TogoVar data or its related transcript details.

Currently, there is no evidence or research directly linking rs886042528 to altered transcript expression in the associated gene (SCN1A or SCN1A-AS1). This variant has been studied in the context of its clinical significance, such as its association with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and severe myoclonic epilepsy, but specific effects on transcript expression are not reported.

If additional studies or curated datasets such as GTEx (Genome-Tissue Expression), RNA-seq studies, or functional analyses become available, they might provide insights into the effect of rs886042528 on transcript expression.
