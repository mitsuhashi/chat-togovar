### Summary:
The rs794726721 variant affects the SCN1A gene and has been strongly implicated in "Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (SMEI)." Two alternate alleles have been observed:
1. G>A (p.Gln910Ter) introduces a truncation, likely disrupting protein function, and is classified as likely pathogenic.
2. G>T (p.Gln910Lys) results in a missense change with high pathogenic potential based on predictive tools and is classified as pathogenic. These changes underline the critical role of SCN1A in neuronal regulation.
