### 1-1. **Basic Variant Information**
- **rs number**: rs794726784  
- **Gene**: SCN1A (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 1)  
- **Transcript Information**:
  - Multiple transcripts show the variant consequences. Notable ones include:
    - **ENST00000303395.9 (SCN1A)**:  
      - **HGVS cDNA**: c.4223G>A  
      - **HGVS Protein**: p.Trp1408Ter  
    - **ENST00000375405.7 (SCN1A)**:  
      - **HGVS cDNA**: c.4190G>A  
      - **HGVS Protein**: p.Trp1397Ter  
    - **ENST00000409050.2 (SCN1A)**:  
      - **HGVS cDNA**: c.4139G>A  
      - **HGVS Protein**: p.Trp1380Ter  

  This variant introduces a premature termination codon, leading to a **stop-gain mutation** (**SO_0001587**).

- **Position**: Chromosome 2, 166002533 (GRCh38/hg38).  
- **Reference/Alternate Allele**: C>T.

### 1-2. **Association with Diseases** (ClinVar and Predictions)
- According to **ClinVar** and **MGEND**, this variant is classified as **Pathogenic (P)**.  
- Disease associations:
  - **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (SMEI)** (MedGen: C0751122).
  - **Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 2 (GEFSP2)** (MedGen: C1858673).
- Functional effect:
  - Introduces a truncation mutation in the SCN1A gene, likely impairing protein function.  
- Predictive tools:
  - Predictions from **SIFT, PolyPhen, and AlphaMissense** are unavailable.

### 1-3. **Literature Information**
No specific literature excerpts are provided.

### 1-4. **Allele Frequencies in Populations**
No allele frequency data were provided for comparison between Japanese and non-Japanese populations. Thus, population-specific differences cannot be determined.

### 1-5. **GWAS Results**
