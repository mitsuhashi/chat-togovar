### **1-2. Relationship with Diseases**
This variant has been associated with several disorders, based on *ClinVar* submissions:
1. **Pathogenic (P):**
   - *Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, type 13* (MedGen ID: C3281191)
   - *Complex neurodevelopmental disorder* (MedGen ID: C5568766)
   - *Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression bursts* (MedGen ID: C0393706)
   - *Not provided* (MedGen ID: C3661900)

2. **Predictions:**
   - ClinVar significance ranges from **Pathogenic** to **Not Provided (NP)** for different submissions.  
   - **SIFT:** Predicted as likely damaging (score: 0.0).  
   - **PolyPhen-2:** For the G>A substitution, the score is **0.518** (possibly damaging). For the G>T substitution, the score is **0.742** (probably damaging).  
   - **AlphaMissense:** Predicted pathogenicity scores are **0.7649 (G>A)** and **0.9467 (G>T)**, suggesting moderate-to-high pathogenicity.

### **Summary**
The variant **rs796053229**, located in the *SCN8A* gene, has been associated with epilepsy-related disorders and complex neurodevelopmental conditions. Its pathogenicity has been evaluated as "pathogenic" with computational tools and clinical submissions supporting its role in some severe disorders. Pathogenic predictions show a high likelihood of functional impact, especially the G>T substitution. The variant appears to be extremely rare in the general population.
