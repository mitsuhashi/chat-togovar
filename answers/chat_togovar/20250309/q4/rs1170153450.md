### Information on rs1170153450:

#### 1-1. **Basic Details**:
- **RS Number**: [rs1170153450](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs1170153450)
- **HGVS Nomenclature**:
  - **Genomic**: `chr12:g.102958246T>A`
  - **Transcript (ASCL1)**:
    - `ENST00000266744.4:c.2T>A`
    - Protein: `ENSP00000266744.3:p.Met1?` (likely impact on the start codon)
  - **Transcript (PAH)**:
    - `ENST00000547319.1:n.165A>T`
- **Gene Name**: The variant lies within two genes:
  - **ASCL1** (achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1)
  - **PAH** (phenylalanine hydroxylase)
- **Transcript Names**:
  - ASCL1: ENST00000266744, NM_004316
  - PAH: ENST00000547319, NM_001354304

#### 1-2. **Relationship with Diseases**:
- **ClinVar**: No clinical significance reported (status: NC, Uncertain).
  - **SIFT (ASCL1)**: `0.0` (deleterious)
  - **PolyPhen (ASCL1)**: Not predicted (details unclear)
  - **AlphaMissense**: No entry.
- Potential involvement with ASCL1 and PAH:
  - ASCL1 is a transcription factor relevant to neuronal differentiation.
  - PAH mutations can lead to phenylketonuria (PKU) or hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA); however, no known association has been reported here.

#### 1-3. **Literature Evidence**:
- No specific literature referencing rs1170153450 was identified in external data.

#### 1-4. **Allele Frequencies**:
- From the **gnomAD database** (global population):
  - Allele count: 1
  - Frequency: 6.58 × 10⁻⁶ (very rare globally).
- From the **NCBN cohort**:
  - Frequency: 4.28 × 10⁻⁵ (slightly higher but still rare).

#### 1-5. **GWAS Results**:
- No phenotypes were associated with this variant in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
