Hereâ€™s the information about variant **rs571414497** based on the provided TogoVar API response:

### **1. General Information**
- **rs ID:** [rs571414497](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs571414497)
- **Gene:** ALOXE3
- **Chromosome and Position:** Chromosome 17, position 8116869
- **Reference/Alternate Allele:** T>C
- **HGVS and Transcript Details:**  
  - **HGVS (Protein Change):** The most commonly listed change is **p.Ile87Val** (isoleucine to valine substitution), though some transcripts show different numbers (e.g., **p.Ile219Val**, **p.Ile254Val**).  
  - **HGVS (cDNA Change):** Example c.259A>G (varies slightly by transcript).

  - See [gnomAD page](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/17-8116869-T-C?dataset=gnomad_r4) for additional details.

### **2. Functional Predictions**
- **SIFT:** 1.0 (Tolerated)  
- **PolyPhen-2:** Ranges from 0.009 to 0.02 (Benign).  
- **AlphaMissense:** 0.1493 (low likelihood of pathogenicity).

### **3. Disease Association**
- TogoVar does not provide annotations for disease association based on databases like ClinVar for this variant. It is currently classified with **no clinical significance (NC)**.

### **4. Population Frequencies**
- The allele frequencies across populations are as follows:
  - **gnomAD Exomes:** 8.89e-06 (13 alleles observed out of 1,461,892 tested).
  - **gnomAD Genomes:** 6.56e-06 (1 allele observed out of 152,338 tested).
  - **NCBN (Japanese):** 4.25e-05 (1 allele observed out of 23,532 tested). This suggests a rare variant globally, with a slightly higher frequency in Japanese populations.

### **5. Literature**
- No mentions of related literature or studies were provided in this dataset.

### **6. Associated Traits (GWAS)**
- No GWAS data is linked to this variant according to the API.

#### **Summary**:
The variant **rs571414497** is a rare missense mutation in the **ALOXE3** gene, causing an amino acid substitution (Ile87Val in most transcripts). Current evidence suggests the variant is **likely benign** based on computational predictions and its low allele frequency across populations. There are no known disease associations or GWAS traits linked to this variant. While it occurs in some Japanese genomes, it remains rare globally.
