### Summary
The SCN1A variant **rs796052984** includes two alleles (C>G and C>T) and is potentially significant in clinical contexts. The **C>G** change is classified as "Likely Pathogenic," while the **C>T** change is of "Uncertain Significance." Functional prediction tools suggest a high likelihood of damaging effects for both alleles. There is limited frequency data globally, and no specific analysis for Japanese populations or GWAS results is available. This variant primarily affects the **SCN1A** gene, which is associated with sodium channel functionality and diseases like epilepsy.
