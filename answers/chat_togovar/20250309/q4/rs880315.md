### 1-3. Literature:
No literature describing rs880315 was referenced in this dataset.

---

### 1-4. Population Frequencies:
The allele frequencies across populations are as follows:
- **Japanese (ToMMo)**: High frequency (AF = 0.681)  
- **Non-Japanese (gnomAD genomes)**: Lower frequency (AF = 0.330)  

This demonstrates a significant difference, with rs880315 being more frequent in Japanese populations. Similar high frequencies were observed in other datasets focusing on Japanese cohorts (e.g., JGA SNP and WGS projects).
