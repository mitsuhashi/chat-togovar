There is no available data specifically about the allele frequency of rs1470044177 in Japanese populations based on the TogoVar API query provided. However, the general allele frequency is documented in the gnomAD dataset as follows:

- **gnomAD Genomes**: Allele Frequency (AF) = 6.57 × 10⁻⁶ (1 allele observed out of 152,144 total alleles analyzed)
- **gnomAD Exomes**: Allele Frequency (AF) = 0.0 (no observed alleles among 1,383,586 total alleles analyzed)

If you need further details specific to Japanese populations, I recommend checking additional population-specific genomic datasets such as the Japanese Genome Variation Database (JGVD) or the ToMMo Japanese Genotype Database.
