### **1-1: Variant Information**

- **rs Number**: rs886042528  
- **Gene Name**: SCN1A  
- **HGVS**: Multiple transcripts with the variant c.1264G>T (Val422Leu) or c.1264G>A (Val422Met).  
- **Transcript Names**: Examples include:
  - ENST00000303395.9 (canonical transcript)

### **1-2: Relationship with Disease**  
This variant is associated with **epileptic encephalopathy** and **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (SMEI)**. Disease relationship and pathogenicity predictions include:

- **ClinVar**: Classified as *likely pathogenic (LP)* or *pathogenic (P)*:
  - Associated condition: **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 6B** (MedGen: C5543353) or **Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (C0751122)**.

- **Predictions**:
  - **SIFT**: Deleterious (score: **0.0**) → Indicates a high likelihood of functional impact.  
  - **PolyPhen**: Damaging (scores range from **0.007** to **0.999**, depending on the transcript).  
  - **AlphaMissense**: High pathogenicity score (**0.9663–0.9728**).  

Functional consequence: These substitutions (Val422Leu or Val422Met) likely disrupt the sodium channel's function, impairing neuronal excitability and contributing to seizure phenotypes.

### **1-3: Literature**
Variants in SCN1A, especially affecting critical domains (like arginine-rich transmembrane segments), are widely implicated in epileptic conditions. Specific to **Val422**, the modifications likely alter channel gating properties, as sodium channels are essential for propagating action potentials in neurons. No specific title from TogoVar API or additional literature is available.

---

### **1-4: Population Frequencies**
No allele frequency data was reported for either Japanese or non-Japanese populations based on the TogoVar API. This indicates that the variant may be extraordinarily rare or observed only in clinical contexts.

---

### **1-5: GWAS/Phenotypes**
The TogoVar API does not directly report GWAS findings for rs886042528. However, SCN1A variants are linked to phenotypes like **febrile seizures**, **Dravet syndrome**, and **generalized epilepsy** based on existing functional studies.
