The API response provided above does not contain specific allele frequencies for the Japanese population. It only shows cumulative frequencies from gnomAD Exomes and Genomes datasets, but no data is explicitly broken out by Japanese populations.

If you need allele frequency data specifically for Japanese populations, you might explore other databases, such as the Japanese Multi-Omics Reference Panel (jMorp) or the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD), as they focus on genomic data from Japanese individuals.
