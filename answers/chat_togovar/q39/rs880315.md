       - `NM_017766.5:c.-77+23892A>G`
   - **Gene**: [CASZ1](https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:26002)
   - **Transcript IDs**: ENST00000344008, ENST00000377022, NM_001079843, NM_017766, XM_017001540, XM_047423404

#### 2. **Cis-Acting Element Effects**
   - The variant rs880315 is located in the **intronic region** of the **CASZ1** gene. Intronic variants can potentially affect **cis-acting regulatory elements**, such as enhancers, silencers, or splicing regulatory sequences.
   - **Most Severe Consequence**: The variant is classified as an **intron variant** (`SO_0001627`), which suggests it does not directly alter protein-coding sequences but may influence gene regulation or splicing.

   - **Functional Predictions**:
     - No specific data from **SIFT**, **PolyPhen**, or **AlphaMissense** is available for this variant, indicating that its functional impact on protein structure or function has not been directly assessed.
     - Intronic variants like rs880315 may affect **splicing enhancers or silencers**, potentially altering the splicing of CASZ1 transcripts. However, no direct evidence or experimental validation is currently available for this variant.

#### 3. **Disease Associations**
   - No clinical significance has been reported for rs880315 in databases like ClinVar. It is currently classified as **"NC" (No Clinical Significance)**.

#### 4. **Allele Frequency Comparison**
   - The allele frequencies of rs880315 show significant differences between Japanese and non-Japanese populations:
     - **Japanese Populations**:
       - Tohoku Medical Megabank (ToMMo): 68.1% (C allele)
       - GEM-J WGA: 68.8% (C allele)
       - JGA WGS: 69.2% (C allele)
     - **Non-Japanese Populations**:
       - gnomAD Genomes: 33.0% (C allele)
     - This suggests that rs880315 may have population-specific regulatory effects, potentially linked to local adaptation or genetic drift.

#### 5. **GWAS Findings**
   - No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have directly linked rs880315 to specific phenotypes or traits.
