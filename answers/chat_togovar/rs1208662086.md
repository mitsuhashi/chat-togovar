Based on the data provided, there is no specific information regarding the allele frequency of rs1208662086 in Japanese populations. The allele frequency is mentioned for overall populations included in gnomAD:

- In **gnomAD exomes**: Allele count (AC) = 1, allele frequency (AF) = 7.14 x 10⁻⁷, allele number (AN) = 1,399,932.
- In **gnomAD genomes**: Allele count (AC) = 1, allele frequency (AF) = 6.57 x 10⁻⁶, allele number (AN) = 152,204.

For further studies on population-specific allele frequencies, including Japanese cohorts, a different database or study would be required as the gnomAD dataset provided does not specify Japanese population data.
