Certainly! The allele frequency data for the rs671 variant in Japanese populations is listed below:

1. **Source: JGA (Japanese Genotype Archive) SNP**  
   - Allele Frequency (AF): 0.2460 (24.60%)  
   - Total Allele Count (AN): 365,930  

2. **Source: TOMMO (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization)**  
   - Allele Frequency (AF): 0.1925 (19.25%)  
   - Total Allele Count (AN): 108,604  

3. **Source: GEM-J WGA (Genome Medical Alliance Japan)**  
   - Allele Frequency (AF): 0.2360 (23.60%)  
   - Total Allele Count (AN): 15,008  

Other smaller datasets also provide frequencies consistent with these results.

**Differences between datasets**: The frequencies vary slightly between datasets due to differences in sample size and regional representation within Japan. However, all sources report that the minor allele of rs671 is relatively prevalent in Japanese populations.
