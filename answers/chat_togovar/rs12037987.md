Below is the information available for the rs12037987 (1:112500200, T>C):

### 1-1. Variant Details
- **rs Number**: [rs12037987](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs12037987)
- **Gene Name**: *WNT2B*
- **Transcript Names**: 
  - ENST00000256640.9 (HGVS: ENST00000256640.9:c.-94-14674T>C)
  - ENST00000369686.9 (HGVS: ENST00000369686.9:c.125+9119T>C)
  - NM_001291880.1 (HGVS: NM_001291880.1:c.-94-14674T>C)
  - NM_004185.4 (HGVS: NM_004185.4:c.125+9119T>C)

The variant lies in the *WNT2B* gene, but it is categorized under "SO_0001627" (intron variant). Since it does not affect a coding region directly, the effect on *WNT2B* gene structure and function appears to be regulatory, potentially altering splicing or transcription, though specific functional experimental data is not available.
