# ChatTogoVar

The TogoVar API data does not provide any direct information regarding how the rs762927460 single nucleotide variant (SNV) affects transcript expression. Transcriptional or functional impact on expression levels would typically require data from transcriptomic or functional analysis studies, which are not included here.

For additional insights, independent experiments such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or functional assays would be required to evaluate the variant's effect on transcript expression. 

If more specific data becomes available, it might be found in relevant literature or specialized experimental databases.
