There is no direct information regarding how rs796053229 specifically affects transcript expression from the TogoVar API or the provided data. The variant is annotated in the SCN8A gene and has functional consequences such as amino acid substitutions (e.g., Arg1872Gln and Arg1831Leu) associated with disease.

If additional studies or expression data are available in sources beyond the TogoVar dataset, they could provide insights into whether this variant impacts gene or transcript regulation. However, at present, no data is explicitly linked to transcript expression effects for this variant.
