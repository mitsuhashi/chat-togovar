There is no information from the provided TogoVar API results or external sources about how the variant **rs763684724** directly affects transcript expression. The available data focuses on its genomic details, protein consequences, population frequencies, and disease predictions but does not address transcript expression analysis or functional studies.

### Key Details from TogoVar Data:
- **rs number**: [rs763684724](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs763684724)
- **Gene**: SCN1B
- **Transcript and protein annotations**:
  - **ENST00000415950.5:c.595C>T (p.Pro199Ser)** (missense variant; PolyPhen score = 0.108, SIFT = 0.07)
  - Other transcripts are linked to intronic or synonymous changes without experimental evidence for expression-level effects.

### Prediction Tools and Population Frequencies:
- The variant is rare in global datasets (allele frequency: 1.38e-6 in gnomAD exomes).
- Predictions (PolyPhen and SIFT) classify it as **benign/tolerated**, suggesting it may not have a strong biological impact on protein function, indirectly affecting its transcription.

If you have experimental data or specific transcriptomic studies you want analyzed, please provide more context! Otherwise, further exploration of functional studies would be needed to address transcript expression effects explicitly.
