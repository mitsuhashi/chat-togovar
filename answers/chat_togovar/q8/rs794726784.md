There is no specific information available in the provided TogoVar API results or other curated sources that directly discusses how the variant **rs794726784** affects transcript expression.

However, the variant **rs794726784** is associated with a change at position **chr2:166002533 (C>T)** within the **SCN1A** gene, leading to a premature stop codon (e.g., **p.Trp1397Ter** or similar, depending on the transcript). Such mutations often result in **nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)**, a cellular mechanism that prevents the accumulation of potentially harmful truncated proteins by degrading transcripts containing premature stop codons. This is a possible mechanism by which this variant could alter transcript expression levels. However, experimental evidence would be needed to confirm this effect specifically in the context of this variant.
