There is no direct evidence in the provided TogoVar API data regarding the specific effect of **rs876660744** on transcript expression.

However, based on the details retrieved from TogoVar, rs876660744 is a variant in the **CDH1** gene. It appears in multiple transcripts with different impacts, such as coding and non-coding consequences. While functions such as **missense substitutions (e.g., Thr303Ala)** may influence protein structure and function, the API data does not clarify whether the variant directly affects transcript expression levels or stability.

If you require further information or literature analysis on the variant's effect on transcript levels, a search in databases like PubMed or functional studies on CDH1 could provide insights.
