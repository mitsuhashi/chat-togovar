# ChatTogoVar

There is currently no specific information from the TogoVar API or related literature directly describing how rs727504136 affects transcript expression levels. However, this variant, located in the **SCN1A** gene, is a medically significant variant as it introduces a premature stop codon (e.g., p.Arg1245Ter in certain reference transcripts), which would likely result in a truncated or non-functional protein. Such mutations often lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a mechanism where transcripts containing premature stop codons are degraded to prevent the production of dysfunctional proteins. This would reduce or eliminate the expression of this transcript in affected cells.

If more specific experimental data or studies are sought, further investigation in the literature or functional studies might be needed.
