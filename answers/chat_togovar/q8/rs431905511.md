# ChatTogoVar

The TogoVar information provided does not explicitly mention how the variant **rs431905511** affects transcript expression. The available data mainly focus on the pathogenicity and structural consequences of the variant:

- **Gene Involved**: The variant is located in the **SNCA** gene.
- **Variant Type and Consequence**: The variant results in a missense change (*c.152G>A*, leading to *p.Gly51Asp*) across multiple transcripts of the SNCA gene.
- **Disease Association**: This variant is linked to **Autosomal Dominant Parkinson Disease 1** (ClinVar ID: [VCV000097000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/97000)).
- **Predictive Scores**:
  - SIFT predicts the variant to be "deleterious" (score: 0.03).
  - PolyPhen classifies it as "probably damaging" (score: 0.996).
  - AlphaMissense score is 0.7612, indicating a significant likelihood of affecting protein function.

However, while these annotations indicate functional importance and disease association, no direct link to transcript expression changes is provided in the TogoVar dataset or the information available.
