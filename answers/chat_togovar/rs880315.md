### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases
The rs880315 variant, located in an intronic region of the **CASZ1** gene, does not currently have a clinically curated disease association in ClinVar. Prediction tools such as **AlphaMissense**, **SIFT**, and **PolyPhen** are not applicable, as this is a non-coding variant.

The **CASZ1** gene, however, plays a role in cardiovascular development and may influence phenotypes related to heart and vascular diseases. Variants in this gene have been studied for their potential role in hypertension and congenital heart abnormalities, but rs880315 itself lacks explicit clinical annotations.

### 1-3. Literature Review
There is limited direct literature addressing rs880315 specifically; however, broader studies on **CASZ1** suggest its involvement in:
- **Hypertension regulation**: CASZ1 has been implicated in blood pressure regulation in genome-wide studies.
- **Cardiac development**: Loss or dysfunction of CASZ1 is associated with structural defects in heart development.

Further targeted studies are required to confirm its causative link to specific clinical phenotypes.

### 1-4. Population Allele Frequencies
- **Japanese Populations**:  
  - **ToMMo**: 68.1% (AF = 0.681)  
  - **JGA-SNP**: 68.1%  
  - **JGA-WGS**: 69.2%
  - **GEM-J WGA**: 68.8%  

- **Non-Japanese Populations**:  
  - **gnomAD** (global data): 33.0% (AF = 0.330)  

The allele frequency of rs880315 is significantly higher in Japanese populations compared to non-Japanese. This suggests population-specific differences, potentially influenced by genetic drift or local selective pressures.

### 1-5. GWAS and Related Phenotypes
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) do not directly associate rs880315 with specific phenotypes, but **CASZ1** variants have been linked to:
- **Blood pressure variation**  
- **Hypertensive phenotypes**  
- **Neuroblastoma susceptibility**  

While rs880315 is not identified as a lead SNP in GWAS, its proximity to other functional CASZ1 variants suggests it could act as a marker for genetic studies focused on these phenotypes.
