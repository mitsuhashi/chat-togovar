### 1-3. Literature Evidence:
No explicit information or literature related to the structural or functional impact of rs880315 is included in the dataset.

---

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies Across Populations:
The allele frequency data for rs880315 shows significant differences between populations:  
- **Japanese datasets** (e.g., TOMMO, GEM Japan WGA): Allele frequency ~ 68%-69%.  
- **Non-Japanese datasets** (e.g., gnomAD Genomes): Allele frequency ~ 33%.

This disparity suggests potential population-specific differences, but no indication is provided if this affects CASZ1 function.

### Summary:
No experimental evidence shows how rs880315 affects the CASZ1 gene's structure or function. Its clinical significance and predicted impact remain unclear, though allele frequency differences across populations may suggest potential adaptive variation. To understand its effect, further functional studies are needed.
