There is no specific allele frequency data available for rs796053229 in Japanese populations based on the provided TogoVar API results or other accompanying data. The allele frequency reported comes from the gnomAD database (exomes), where it is very rare, with an allele frequency of **6.84 x 10^-7**.

If you have a dataset specific to Japanese populations, additional analysis may be required to determine its frequency there.
