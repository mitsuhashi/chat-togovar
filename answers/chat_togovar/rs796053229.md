### Information about rs796053229 Allele's Effect on Structure and Function:

The provided TogoVar API data includes valuable information about rs796053229, which is located in the **SCN8A gene**, encoding the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 8. Below is an analysis of its structural and functional impacts:

---

### 1. **Variant Information:**
   - **rs number:** rs796053229
   - **Gene name:** SCN8A
   - **Position (GRCh38):** Chr12:51807101
   - **Reference and alternate alleles:** G>A or G>T
   - **Consequence:** Missense variant producing a non-synonymous change.

### 2. **Predicted Impacts on Protein Function:**
   - **Missense Change:**
     - **Protein Changes (HGVS):**
       - For `G>A`: Results in a substitution of **Arginine (Arg) to Glutamine (Gln)** at specific positions, such as **Arg1831Gln** (or Arg1872Gln depending on the transcript).
       - For `G>T`: Results in a substitution of **Arginine (Arg) to Leucine (Leu)**, such as **Arg1831Leu** (or Arg1872Leu).
     - **Functional Predictions:**
       - **SIFT score:** 0.0 (Damaging for both G>A and G>T; scores closer to zero suggest a higher likelihood of an impact on function).
       - **PolyPhen-2:**
         - G>A: 0.518 (possibly damaging; scores between 0.15 and 1.0 indicate varying susceptibility).
         - G>T: 0.742 (likely damaging).
       - **AlphaMissense:** 
         - G>A: 0.7649 (high pathogenic potential; closer to 1 indicates increased severity).
         - G>T: 0.9467 (very high pathogenic potential).

### 3. **Structural and Functional Effects:**
   - **Nature of Substitution:**
     - Arginine is a positively charged, polar residue, crucial for maintaining the structural stability of ion channels.
     - Substitution to **Glutamine (neutral, polar)** or **Leucine (neutral, hydrophobic)** likely alters the protein's charge dynamics and functional interactions, potentially affecting ion transport.
   - **Impact on Sodium Channel Activity (SCN8A):**
     - SCN8A encodes the Nav1.6 channel, critical for neuronal excitability and propagation of action potentials.
     - Missense mutations in SCN8A often disrupt channel gating, leading to hyperactivation or inactivation of the sodium channel, which may result in neurological disorders (see disease associations below).

### 4. **Relationship with Diseases:**
According to ClinVar data:
1. G>A Mutation:
   - Associated Conditions:
     - **Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 13 (DEE13)**
     - **Complex neurodevelopmental disorder**
     - **Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE)**
   - Clinical Significance: Classified as **Pathogenic (P)**.
2. G>T Mutation:
   - Associated Conditions:
     - **Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE)**
   - Clinical Significance: Also classified as **Pathogenic (P)**.

### 5. **Population Differences in Allele Frequency:**
   - **G>A Mutation:** Extremely rare in the general population. Reported in gnomAD exomes with an allele frequency of **0.000000684** (1/1,461,706 alleles). No specific population-specific frequency comparison (Japanese vs. non-Japanese) is available in TogoVar.

   - **G>T Mutation:** No frequency data available, likely indicating it is an even rarer mutation.
