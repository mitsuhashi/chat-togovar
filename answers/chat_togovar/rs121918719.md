### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases:
This variant is associated with **Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis (ARCI-1)**. Key details:
- **ClinVar** clinical significance: Classified as **Pathogenic (P)** and **Likely Pathogenic (LP)**.
- **Conditions linked**:
  - **Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis 1** ([MedGen C4551630](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C4551630))
  - **Abnormality of the skin** ([MedGen C5848159](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C5848159))

### Prediction Tools:
- **SIFT**: Score of **0.0**, indicating a **deleterious impact** on protein function.
- **PolyPhen-2**: Score of **0.995**, suggesting this variant is **probably damaging**.
- **AlphaMissense**: Score of **0.8876**, predicting a high likelihood of it being pathogenic.

### Effect on Structure and Function:
The substitution of arginine (a positively charged amino acid) with histidine (a residue with a different charge and pKa) at position 143 likely affects the enzyme's stability, substrate binding, or catalytic activity. This underscores its significant role in causing improper crosslinking of proteins in the cornified envelope, contributing to severe skin barrier defects observed in ARCI.
