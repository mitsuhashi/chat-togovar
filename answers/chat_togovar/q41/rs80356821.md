### Analysis of rs80356821 Variant and Similar Variants

The rs80356821 variant is a deletion in the **HBB (beta-globin)** gene, specifically a 4-base pair deletion (c.126_129del) that results in a **frameshift mutation**. This mutation leads to a premature stop codon (p.Phe42LeufsTer19), which disrupts the normal function of the beta-globin protein. This variant is associated with **beta-thalassemia**, a hereditary blood disorder characterized by reduced or absent beta-globin chain production.

To identify variants with similar effects, we focus on other mutations in the **HBB gene** that cause frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, or other severe disruptions leading to beta-thalassemia or related hemoglobinopathies.

### 1. Variants with Similar Effects
Here are some examples of variants in the **HBB gene** that have similar effects to rs80356821:

#### a. **Frameshift Mutations**
- **c.92_95del (p.Phe31LeufsTer80)**: A 4-base pair deletion causing a frameshift and premature stop codon, leading to beta-thalassemia.
- **c.27dupG (p.Ser10ValfsTer14)**: A single-base duplication causing a frameshift and early termination of the protein.

#### b. **Nonsense Mutations**
- **c.118C>T (p.Gln40Ter)**: A single nucleotide change resulting in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and nonfunctional beta-globin protein.
- **c.93C>A (p.Tyr31Ter)**: Another nonsense mutation causing early termination of the protein.

#### c. **Splice Site Mutations**
- **IVS-I-110 (G>A)**: A mutation in the first intron of the HBB gene that disrupts normal splicing, leading to abnormal beta-globin production.
- **IVS-II-654 (C>T)**: A mutation in the second intron that also affects splicing and results in beta-thalassemia.

#### d. **Large Deletions**
- **Sicilian Deletion (c.316-197_c.316-146del)**: A large deletion in the HBB gene that removes critical regions, leading to beta-thalassemia.

### 2. Disease Associations
All the above variants are associated with **beta-thalassemia** or related hemoglobinopathies, such as:
- **Beta-thalassemia major**: Severe anemia requiring regular blood transfusions.
- **Beta-thalassemia intermedia**: Milder anemia with variable clinical severity.
- **Hb E-beta thalassemia**: A compound heterozygous condition involving the Hb E variant and a beta-thalassemia mutation.

### 3. Predictive Models and Functional Impact
For these variants, predictive models like **SIFT**, **PolyPhen**, and **AlphaMissense** are not typically applicable because the mutations result in frameshifts or nonsense changes, which are inherently damaging. These mutations are classified as **pathogenic** in databases like ClinVar.

### 4. Population-Specific Allele Frequencies
The rs80356821 variant has a low allele frequency globally:
- **gnomAD Exomes**: 0.009% (rare).
- **gnomAD Genomes**: 0.01% (rare).
- **Japanese Population**: No specific data available for this variant, but beta-thalassemia is generally rare in Japan.

Similar variants also tend to have low allele frequencies, as beta-thalassemia is more common in regions like the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

### 5. GWAS Findings
Variants in the **HBB gene** are not typically identified in GWAS studies for complex traits, as they are primarily associated with monogenic disorders like beta-thalassemia.
