There is no allele frequency data for **rs587782044** specifically in Japanese populations available from the provided TogoVar API search results. The allele frequency data given pertains to the global population from the **gnomAD** datasets, which include the following:

- **gnomAD Exomes**: Allele count (AC) = 4, allele frequency (AF) = 2.7369899271434406e-06, total alleles (AN) = 1461458.
- **gnomAD Genomes**: Allele count (AC) = 6, allele frequency (AF) = 3.94296002923511e-05, total alleles (AN) = 152170.

These data do not specify frequencies for Japanese individuals. For further insights on Japanese-specific allele frequencies, other databases like the **ToMMo 8.3KJPN** or similar population-specific resources might need to be consulted.
