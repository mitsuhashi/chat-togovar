### Variant rs587782044 and Its Influence on Clinical Phenotype

#### **1-1. SNP Information**  
- **rsID:** [rs587782044](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs587782044)  
- **Gene:** *CDH1* (Cadherin-1)  
- **Transcripts Affected:** The variant impacts multiple transcripts of *CDH1*.  
  - Examples include:  
    - **NM_004360.5:c.1687G>A:** Results in **p.Ala563Thr**  
    - **NM_004360.5:c.1687G>T:** Results in **p.Ala563Ser**  

#### **1-2. Relationship with Disease**  
Based on [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar):  
- **Associated Conditions**:  
  - Hereditary Cancer-Predisposing Syndrome (MedGen: [C0027672](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0027672))  
  - Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Adenocarcinoma (HDGC) (MedGen: [C1708349](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C1708349))  
- **Predictions of Pathogenicity:**  
  - **SIFT**:  
    - c.1687G>A → p.Ala563Thr: **0.00 (deleterious)**  
    - c.1687G>T → p.Ala563Ser: **0.01 (deleterious)**  
  - **PolyPhen-2:**  
    - c.1687G>A → p.Ala563Thr: **0.887 (possibly/probably damaging)**  
    - c.1687G>T → p.Ala563Ser: **0.936 to 0.987 (likely damaging)**  
  - **AlphaMissense**: Low scores (e.g., **0.136–0.1621**) suggest no strong missense-driven association.  

### Clinical Impact:  
The *CDH1* gene encodes E-cadherin, a key protein in cell-cell adhesion and epithelial integrity. Both the Ala563Thr and Ala563Ser substitutions occur at the extracellular domain of E-cadherin, likely altering its structural and functional properties. These changes impair normal adhesion, thereby promoting tumorigenesis in hereditary cancer syndromes, specifically HDGC and related cancers.  

#### **1-4. Allele Frequencies Among Populations**  
- The G>A variant frequency is extremely rare and not consistently observed in gnomAD datasets.  
- For **G>T**:  
  - **gnomAD Exomes:** Allele Frequency (AF): 2.736 × 10^-6 (4 carriers among 1,461,458 alleles)  
  - **gnomAD Genomes:** AF: 3.943 × 10^-5 (6 carriers among 152,170 alleles)  
  These low frequencies align with the rare autosomal dominant inheritance of associated conditions like hereditary cancer syndromes.  

#### **1-5. GWAS and Phenotype**  
No genome-wide association study (GWAS) directly associates rs587782044 with non-malignant traits. However, its rarity and presence in clinical cases point to its contribution to hereditary cancer syndromes, likely underrepresented in broad GWAS datasets.
