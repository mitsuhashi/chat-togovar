The variant **rs1201448391** is located in the **ALOX12B** gene on chromosome 17. Here's a detailed breakdown of its potential influence on clinical phenotypes using the requested categories:

---

### **1-1. Variant Information**
- **Variant ID**: rs1201448391  
- **Gene**: ALOX12B (Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase, 12R-Type)  
- **Location**: Chromosome 17:8075595  
- **HGVS Names**:
  - **C>A** variant:
    - Protein: ENSP00000497784.1:p.Gly552Cys
    - Transcript: ENST00000647874.1:c.1654G>T
  - **C>G** variant:
    - Protein: ENSP00000497784.1:p.Gly552Arg
    - Transcript: ENST00000647874.1:c.1654G>C

### **1-2. Relationship With Diseases (Clinical Impact)**
- **ClinVar**: The variant is reported as having no clinical significance (label: NC).  
- **Predictive Scores**:
  - **C>A variant**:
    - **SIFT**: 0.01 (predicted "deleterious")
    - **PolyPhen-2**: 1.0 (predicted "probably damaging")
    - **AlphaMissense**: 0.4615 (moderately tolerated)
  - **C>G variant**:
    - **SIFT**: 0.0 (predicted "deleterious")
    - **PolyPhen-2**: 1.0 (predicted "probably damaging")
    - **AlphaMissense**: 0.46 (moderately tolerated)

These predictions indicate potential deleterious effects on the protein due to amino acid changes (**p.Gly552Cys** or **p.Gly552Arg**) in the gene's translated product. However, direct clinical association to a disease is not reported in public databases.

### **1-3. Literature Evidence**
No direct literature currently links this exact variant to known diseases or phenotypes.

---

### **1-4. Allele Frequencies**
- **Japanese Populations**:
  - **C>A variant**:
    - jMorp (Japanese): AF = 3.7 x 10⁻⁵ (rare)
  - **C>G variant**:
    - Undetected
- **Non-Japanese Populations**:
  - **gnomAD** (Non-Japanese Global Dataset): AF = 1.36 x 10⁻⁶ (extremely rare)

The variant seems to be notably rarer in non-Japanese populations compared to Japanese populations.

### **Clinical Interpretation**
The rs1201448391 variation in **ALOX12B** could alter protein function given its location and the predicted impact (e.g., glycine substitution causing destabilization of the protein structure). Variants in **ALOX12B** have previously been associated with skin diseases such as autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). However, this specific variant has not been directly linked to any confirmed clinical phenotype. The rarity of the variant limits its broad clinical implications without further studies.
