The variant **rs431905511** is located in the **SNCA gene (synuclein alpha)** on chromosome 4 at position 89828154. This variant has been associated with clinical phenotypes, particularly **Autosomal Dominant Parkinson Disease 1**, as cataloged in **ClinVar**.

### Information Related to Phenotype:

1. **Variant Details** (1-1):
   - **rs Number**: [rs431905511](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs431905511)
   - **HGVS**: 
     - cDNA: NM_000345.4:c.152G>A
     - Protein: NP_000336.1:p.Gly51Asp
   - **Gene Name**: SNCA (Synuclein Alpha)
   - **Primary Transcript**: NM_000345.4

2. **Relationship with Disease** (1-2):
   - This variant is directly linked to Parkinson's disease (autosomal dominant) in **ClinVar** (Pathogenic, [ClinVar VCV000097000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/97000)).
   - Predictive impacts from computational tools:
     - **AlphaMissense**: 0.7612 (Moderate likelihood of pathogenicity).
     - **SIFT**: 0.03 (Damaging effect predicted on protein function).
     - **PolyPhen**: 0.996 (Probably damaging).

3. **Mechanism** (1-2 and Literature Information, 1-3):
   - The variant results in a missense change **p.Gly51Asp**, which likely disrupts the normal function of alpha-synuclein, a protein implicated in the development of Lewy bodies—a hallmark of Parkinson's disease.

4. **Allele Frequencies (1-4)**:
   - The allele frequency of **rs431905511** is not reported in large population databases, making it a rare variant. This rarity is compatible with its reported association with a Mendelian disorder.

5. **GWAS and Phenotypes (1-5)**:
   - While specific GWAS studies for rs431905511 were not found, the SNCA gene has been extensively studied in relation to Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

6. **TogoVar Link** (1-6):
   - For detailed variant information: [TogoVar rs431905511](https://togovar.biosciencedbc.jp/en/variant/4-89828154-C-T)

### Influence on Clinical Phenotype:
The **p.Gly51Asp** substitution changes the protein structure of alpha-synuclein, a crucial molecule in neuronal function and synaptic activity. Misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates form Lewy bodies, contributing to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. This variant’s pathogenicity has been confirmed through clinical reports and predictive algorithms, emphasizing its significant influence on the disease phenotype.
