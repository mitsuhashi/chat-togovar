The TogoVar API data does not provide specific information about haplotypes that include the variant rs796053216. Haplotypes are typically determined through linkage disequilibrium studies or population-specific analyses, which are not included in the retrieved data.

However, based on external knowledge, rs796053216 is located in the SCN8A gene on chromosome 12, which is associated with neurological conditions such as epileptic encephalopathy. To identify haplotypes including this variant, one would need to analyze population-level genomic data, such as those from the 1000 Genomes Project or HapMap, or perform a targeted haplotype analysis using tools like PHASE or Haploview.

If you are interested in further exploration, I recommend consulting large-scale genomic datasets or publications that focus on haplotype structures in the SCN8A region.

### English Summary:
- **TogoVar Data**: No haplotype information for rs796053216.
- **External Knowledge**: Haplotype analysis requires population-level genomic data or specialized tools.

### Japanese Summary:
- **TogoVarデータ**: rs796053216を含むハプロタイプに関する情報はありません。
- **外部知識**: ハプロタイプ解析には、集団レベルのゲノムデータや専門的なツールが必要です。
