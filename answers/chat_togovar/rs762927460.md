### 1-1. Variant Information
- **rs number**: rs762927460
- **Gene Name**: SCN1A (gene encoding the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1) and SCN1A-AS1 (antisense RNA).
- **HGVS Notation**:
  - **Variation 1 (T>A)**: 
    - Protein: p.Asp249Val
    - Transcript: Multiple transcripts including ENST00000303395 (ENSP00000303540) and others.
    - Genomic: chr2:g.166051937T>A
  - **Variation 2 (T>C)**: 
    - Protein: p.Asp249Gly
    - Transcript: Multiple transcripts, also including ENST00000303395 and others.
    - Genomic: chr2:g.166051937T>C

### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases and Predictions
1. **ClinVar Significance**:
   - Variation T>A:
     - Clinical Significance: Uncertain Significance (US).
   - Variation T>C:
     - Clinical Significance: Likely Pathogenic (LP) with association to **Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy (EIEE)**.
2. **Function Prediction Tools**:
   - **SIFT**: 0.0 (deleterious).
   - **Polyphen**: High values (0.982-1.0), indicating the variant is "probably damaging."
   - **AlphaMissense**: Extremely high scores (~0.98-0.99), suggesting it is highly deleterious.

### 1-3. Literature
- No direct literature referencing this specific SNP could be found in the current API-provided data.

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies
- For the T>C variation, a frequency is reported in gnomAD:
  - **Allele Frequency (AF)**: ~4.1e-06 (rare variant).
  - This illustrates that the allele is extremely rare in global populations.
- No allele frequency data available specifically for Japanese or non-Japanese populations from the API.

### 1-5. Related GWAS and Phenotypes
- No explicit GWAS results are tied to this variant in the current dataset, but likely pathogenic association with **EIEE**, a severe neurological condition, is noted.

### Additional Notes:
1. **Gene Function Impact**: 
   - The SCN1A gene encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel critical for transmitting action potentials in the brain. Variants impacting the highly conserved aspartic acid (Asp) residue at position 249 may interfere with ion channel function, leading to severe disorders such as EIEE.
