#### (c) **Reference (T) to Alternate (G)**:
- **HGVS annotation**: 
  - **Genomic**: `chr17:g.7674247T>G`
  - **Protein**: `p.Asn239Thr`
  - **Transcript**: NM_000546.6 (`NM_000546.6:c.716A>C`).
- **Gene**: *TP53*.
- **Consequence**: Missense mutation (`SO_0001583`).
- **Predicted Impact**:
  - **SIFT**: Score = 0.0 (damaging).
  - **PolyPhen**: Score = 0.999 (probably damaging).
  - **AlphaMissense**: Score = 0.9759 (strongly suggestive of pathogenicity).
- **Role in Diseases**: 
  Implicated in lung adenocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, and multiple other cancers.

### **2. Structural and Functional Implications**
#### **Gene Structure**:
- All three variants result in missense mutations in the highly conserved DNA-binding domain of the *TP53* protein. This region is critical for its tumor suppressor activity.
  
#### **Gene Function**:
- The *TP53* protein is a well-studied tumor suppressor involved in regulating cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Variants affecting amino acid position 239, such as Asn239Ile, Asn239Ser, and Asn239Thr, likely compromise DNA binding, destabilizing the protein and promoting oncogenesis.

---

### **3. Disease Associations**
- Variants at rs1057519999 are associated with several hereditary cancer syndromes and sporadic cancers, as curated in databases like ClinVar.
- These variants show **clinically significant impacts** (e.g., Li-Fraumeni syndrome) as inferred from the high **pathogenicity scores** shown above.
