### 1-1. Variant Details
- **rs number**: [rs1170153450](https://identifiers.org/dbsnp/rs1170153450)
- **HGVS Notation**:
  - **Genomic**: chr12:g.102958246T>A
  - **Transcript**:
    - For **ASCL1 (transcript ENST00000266744)**: c.2T>A, resulting in **p.Met1?** (disrupts the start codon).
    - For **PAH (transcript ENST00000551337)**: c.-147A>T (located in the promoter or untranslated region).
- **Gene Names**: 
  - **ASCL1**: Achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1
  - **PAH**: Phenylalanine hydroxylase
- **Transcript Names**:
  - Associated transcripts for **ASCL1** and **PAH** as detailed above.

### 1-2. Relationship with Diseases
- **ASCL1**:
  - The variant affects the start codon (p.Met1?), likely disrupting protein translation.
  - Predictive results:
    - **SIFT**: Score 0.0 (deleterious)
    - **PolyPhen**: Unknown
    - **AlphaMissense**: No prediction available.
- **PAH**:
  - The variant overlaps the promoter/untranslated region (c.-147A>T) or other noncoding sites. Potential regulatory effects have not been reported.

No specific disease association has been reported for this variant in **ClinVar**, although functional impacts on protein expression and regulation are plausible, especially for ASCL1.

### 1-3. Literature Context
There is currently no specific literature related to the functional impact of this variant.

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies
- **Global Frequency**:
  - gnomAD genomes: 0.00000658
  - NCBN genomes: 0.0000428
- **Population-Specific Data**:
  - Variant frequency is extremely rare globally. Current datasets do not indicate differences specific to Japanese populations.

### 1-5. GWAS Results
No phenotypes linked to this variant are available from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

### Summary of Impact
- In **ASCL1**, the loss of the start codon (p.Met1?) likely affects protein translation, which could disrupt its role as a transcription factor in neural development.
- In **PAH**, the variant might alter regulatory mechanisms, but no significant evidence has been reported yet.
