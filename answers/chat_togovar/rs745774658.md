The rs745774658 variant is associated with the **SCN2A** gene, which encodes the sodium channel, voltage-gated type II alpha subunit, playing a critical role in the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Below, I will provide specific information about its effects, structure, function, and potential clinical relevance:

### 1-1. Variant Details
- **rs Number**: rs745774658
- **Gene Name**: SCN2A
- **Transcripts**:
  - Major Transcript: **NM_021007.3 (ENST00000283256)**  
    - **cDNA Change (HGVS c)**: c.1399G>A or c.1399G>T  
    - **Protein Change (HGVS p)**: p.Ala467Thr (G>A) or p.Ala467Ser (G>T)  
  - Other Isoforms and Transcripts: Consequences vary but consistently involve the Ala467 codon in many isoforms.

### 1-2. Relationships with Diseases and Pathogenicity Predictions
- **ClinVar Interpretation**:
  - The G>A change (p.Ala467Thr) is classified as **Uncertain Significance (US)** for **developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, 11** and **benign familial infantile seizures 3**.
  - The G>T change (p.Ala467Ser) is designated as **Likely Benign (LB)** for seizure-related conditions.
- **Prediction Tools**:
  - **SIFT**:
    - G>A: Score = 0.03 (potentially damaging)
    - G>T: Score = 0.02 (likely damaging)
  - **PolyPhen-2**:
    - G>A: Score = 0.112 (benign)
    - G>T: Score = 0.617 (possibly damaging)
  - **AlphaMissense**:
    - G>A: Score = 0.0833 (neutral)
    - G>T: Score = 0.0992 (neutral overall)

These computational tools suggest variable impacts on the protein structure and function, with G>T having a possibly marginal effect on protein properties.

### 1-3. Literature on the Variant
No direct publications about **rs745774658** were retrieved from the TogoVar query. However, variants in SCN2A are widely reported in the literature concerning neurological conditions like epilepsy and developmental delays. For specific insights into the functional effects of Ala467 substitutions in SCN2A, such data would need experimental validation.

### 1-4. Allele Frequencies Across Populations
- **Japanese Population (ToMMo)**:
  - G>A: Allele Frequency (AF) = 0.000101 (~1/10,000)
  - G>T: No data reported.
- **GNOMAD (Global Populations)**:
  - G>A:
    - Exomes: AF = 1.71 × 10⁻⁵
    - Genomes: AF = 3.29 × 10⁻⁵
  - G>T:
    - Exomes: AF = 6.16 × 10⁻⁶
  
The allele frequency is significantly lower globally compared to the Japanese population, indicating possible ethnic-specific variation patterns.

### 1-5. GWAS and Phenotypic Associations
No Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results specifically mention **rs745774658**. However, broader studies on SCN2A implicate the gene in disorders like **autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy syndromes, and neurodevelopmental disorders**.

### Summary of Structural and Functional Impact
1. **Location of Variant**: Substitutions at p.Ala467, located within the **6 TM domain of the SCN2A protein**, can potentially alter the sodium channel's gating properties.
2. **Functional Prediction**: While p.Ala467Ser is evaluated as **possibly damaging**, p.Ala467Thr is less likely to have a significant functional effect.
3. **Disease Relevance**:
   - Both variants are not currently confirmed as pathogenic but may have differing impacts on related conditions (e.g., epilepsy or developmental delay).

Further experimental studies are needed to understand the precise molecular and clinical effects of this variant.
