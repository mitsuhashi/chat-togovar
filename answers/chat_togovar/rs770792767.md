The allele frequency of variant **rs770792767** specific to the Japanese population is not provided in the given dataset. The provided data includes only global frequencies from gnomAD:

- **gnomAD exomes:** Allele frequency = 0.000005472 (5.47 x 10⁻⁶)  
- **gnomAD genomes:** Allele frequency = 0.00001314 (1.31 x 10⁻⁵)

For a detailed comparison with allele frequencies in Japanese populations, additional population-specific databases like the 1000 Genomes Project (Japanese cohort) or the ToMMo database (Tohoku Medical Megabank) would need to be consulted.
