### Effect on Gene Function and Structure
The **rs704341** variant is annotated with the consequence term **SO:0001627 (intron variant)**. As such, it resides within an intron, which means it does not directly encode amino acid changes in the protein but may influence gene expression by modifying splicing patterns, regulatory elements, or RNA stability. However, without functional studies or predictions (SIFT/PolyPhen) indicating the specific impact, any precise effect on the gene's structure or function remains speculative.

### Conclusion
Based on the available data, the **rs704341 allele** is an intronic variant of the **PTPRG gene**, with no current evidence directly linking it to altered gene structure or function. Population-based studies suggest its distribution varies among ethnic groups, warranting further investigation to elucidate its functional implications.
