# ChatTogoVar

The evolutionary background of rs121913529 is not explicitly discussed in the TogoVar API data, and evolutionary insights typically require in-depth analyses of allele frequencies, conservation across species, and functional relevance. TogoVar provides information more directly related to human clinical and genomic context, not the evolutionary history of a variant.

## Additional Notes:
- To analyze the evolutionary history of rs121913529, it would be important to investigate its conservation across species using tools like UCSC Genome Browser, CLUSTAL, or related databases that compare sequences across organisms. Variants located in highly conserved regions are more likely to have functional importance.
