The TogoVar API data does not provide detailed evolutionary background information for rs1201448391. Evolutionary information such as conservation across species or selective pressures acting on a variant requires additional sources like comparative genomic studies or specialized databases.

At a basic level, rs1201448391 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identified in the **ALOX12B** gene on chromosome 17. Variants in ALOX12B are of interest due to their potential roles in lipid metabolism and skin barrier functions.

For detailed evolutionary insight, researchers typically evaluate:  
1. **Cross-species conservation**: How conserved is the sequence involving rs1201448391 across different species, indicating potential functional importance?
2. **Selective pressure**: Whether the allele frequency shows signs of positive or negative selection might suggest its evolutionary impact.
3. **Population-specific frequencies**: Differences in allele frequencies between populations (e.g., allele frequency in Japanese vs. non-Japanese populations provided by the TogoVar data) may reflect demographic and evolutionary history.

If you need more information regarding its evolutionary context, studies from larger databases such as Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser may help. Please let me know if you would like to explore that further!
