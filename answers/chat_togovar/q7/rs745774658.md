# ChatTogoVar

There is no evolutionary background information explicitly provided for the variant **rs745774658** in the TogoVar API or the dataset supplied. Evolutionary analysis generally involves understanding the conservation of the genomic region and functional elements across species, which would require additional computational or literature resources. 

If you have other specific details or sources related to the evolutionary background you're interested in, feel free to share, and I can help analyze further. Alternatively, you can explore databases such as UCSC Genome Browser's PhyloP scores or PhastCons scores for conservation insights. 

Let me know if you'd like guidance on other aspects of this variant.
