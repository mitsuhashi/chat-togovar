	•	Total Score: 48/50

	•	Answer GPT-4o
	•	Accuracy Score: 7/10
	•	Reason: The response recommended databases but did not directly provide allele frequency information for rs1201448391 in Japanese populations, leaving the question partially unaddressed.
	•	Completeness Score: 7/10
	•	Reason: While the response listed relevant resources, it failed to provide specific allele frequency data, making the answer insufficiently complete.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 10/10
	•	Reason: The structure of the response was logical and coherent, with no contradictions.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 6/10
	•	Reason: The response was verbose, offering general guidance rather than focusing concisely on the requested data.
	•	Evidence Support Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: While credible databases were mentioned, no direct data or specific evidence was provided for rs1201448391.
	•	Total Score: 35/50

	•	Answer VarChat
	•	Accuracy Score: 2/10
	•	Reason: The response focused on a pathogenic mutation unrelated to the question and did not address allele frequency or Japanese populations at all.
	•	Completeness Score: 3/10
	•	Reason: The response included unrelated genetic details about the ALOX12B gene mutation but completely omitted the requested allele frequency data for rs1201448391.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: While the response was internally consistent about the ALOX12B mutation, it was unrelated to the question asked, creating a misalignment in relevance.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: The response was verbose and contained extraneous information unrelated to the question, making it unclear in context.
	•	Evidence Support Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: The response cited potentially credible studies, but these citations were unrelated to rs1201448391 or its allele frequency in Japanese populations.
