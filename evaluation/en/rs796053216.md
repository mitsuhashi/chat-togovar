Final Result:
	•	Best Answer: Answer 1 (ChatTogoVar)
	•	Total Score for Answer 1 ChatTogoVar: 45/50
	•	Total Score for Answer 2 GPT-4o: 37/50
	•	Total Score for Answer 3 VarChat: 25/50
	•	Reason: Answer 1 provides accurate, concise, and relevant information directly addressing the question, along with appropriate evidence and sources. Answer 2 is well-written but overly verbose and lacks any direct example of allele frequency values. Answer 3 is not relevant to the question and does not offer allele frequency information at all.

Scores by Evaluation Criteria:
	•	Answer ChatTogoVar
	•	Accuracy Score: 10/10
	•	Reason: The answer directly addresses the question by stating that allele frequency information is unavailable for the Japanese population and provides a credible source for independent verification.
	•	Completeness Score: 9/10
	•	Reason: The response is mostly complete but could explicitly mention the absence of the variant in some Japanese-specific databases for absolute clarity.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 10/10
	•	Reason: The response is logically consistent and avoids contradictions.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 9/10
	•	Reason: The response is clear and concise but could remove minor redundancies for an even sharper presentation.
	•	Evidence Support Score: 7/10
	•	Reason: While the sources provided are credible, the response could improve by integrating specific observations from Japanese-centric databases like ToMMo or HGVD when stating the absence of data.
	•	Total Score: 45/50

	•	Answer GPT-4o
	•	Accuracy Score: 8/10
	•	Reason: It provides general guidance on where to find allele frequency information but fails to confirm the absence of the frequency data for Japanese populations directly or explicitly.
	•	Completeness Score: 8/10
	•	Reason: It discusses various relevant databases comprehensively but does not offer specific information or results about the queried SNP.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 10/10
	•	Reason: The explanation is logically structured and consistent throughout.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 6/10
	•	Reason: The response is overly verbose and includes too much background information that may distract from the main question.
	•	Evidence Support Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: Though multiple databases are mentioned, there is no direct citation or verified reference for the specific variant or data, limiting its usefulness.
	•	Total Score: 37/50

	•	Answer VarChat
	•	Accuracy Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: The response does not address the specific query about allele frequency in Japanese populations, diverging significantly into unrelated clinical characteristics of the variant.
	•	Completeness Score: 4/10
	•	Reason: The response lacks any information pertinent to allele frequency data for rs796053216, leaving the user's question unanswered.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: While coherent within its topic of clinical and functional SCN8A variant description, it strays entirely from the query, making the logic misaligned with the question.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: The response is verbose and provides excessive and irrelevant information, introducing unnecessary complexity.
	•	Evidence Support Score: 6/10
	•	Reason: The citations are credible; however, they do not support the specific request regarding allele frequency, reducing their applicability.
	•	Total Score: 25/50
