Final Result:
	•	Best Answer: Answer 1
	•	Total Score for Answer 1 ChatTogoVar : 44/50
	•	Total Score for Answer 2 GPT-4o : 33/50
	•	Total Score for Answer 3 VarChat : 18/50
	•	Reason: Answer 1 offered specific allele frequency data for rs12037987 in Japanese populations, sourced from credible databases with relevant URLs. Answers 2 and 3 were either too generic or off-topic, reducing their utility and accuracy.

Scores by Evaluation Criteria:
	•	Answer ChatTogoVar
	•	Accuracy Score: 9/10
	•	Reason: The allele frequency values provided specifically address the question for Japanese populations using credible data sources. Slight deduction for not explicitly clarifying minor allele details.
	•	Completeness Score: 9/10
	•	Reason: Detailed frequency data from three separate datasets was provided. Small deduction for not discussing broader implications or possible variants across studies.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 10/10
	•	Reason: The response is logically structured and free of contradictions, accurately combining data with appropriate source references.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 8/10
	•	Reason: The response is clear and concise but slightly heavy on repetitive wording (e.g., repeating allele frequency format).
	•	Evidence Support Score: 8/10
	•	Reason: Credible sources are referenced for each dataset, but the URLs provided vary slightly in accessibility and clarity.
	•	Total Score: 44/50

	•	Answer GPT-4o
	•	Accuracy Score: 7/10
	•	Reason: The response advises where to look for allele frequency data (e.g., 1000 Genomes, GnomAD) but does not provide specific allele frequencies for rs12037987 in Japanese populations.
	•	Completeness Score: 6/10
	•	Reason: The response fails to directly answer the main question and instead focuses on offering tools or databases for further searches. Relevant but incomplete.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 8/10
	•	Reason: While logically structured, the response could have been more tightly focused on the specifics of the query instead of general database guidance.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 6/10
	•	Reason: The response is verbose, spending too much time on indirect resources rather than directly answering the question.
	•	Evidence Support Score: 6/10
	•	Reason: The sources mentioned are credible, but no specific data from these sources is retrieved or provided for evaluation.
	•	Total Score: 33/50

	•	Answer VarChat
	•	Accuracy Score: 3/10
	•	Reason: The response is off-topic, discussing stroke associations of rs12037987 rather than providing allele frequency data in Japanese populations.
	•	Completeness Score: 3/10
	•	Reason: It completely misses the primary request for allele frequency data and instead focuses on unrelated aspects like disease associations.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: While the explanation regarding WNT2B and its pathways is logical, it has no relevance to the question asked.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 4/10
	•	Reason: The response is overly verbose with excessive detail on unrelated studies, making it unclear and unhelpful in this context.
	•	Evidence Support Score: 3/10
	•	Reason: Citations are research-focused rather than addressing allele frequencies, making the evidence irrelevant for the given question.
	•	Total Score: 18/50
