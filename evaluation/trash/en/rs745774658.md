Scores by Evaluation Criteria:
	•	Answer ChatTogoVar
	•	Accuracy Score: 10/10
	•	Reason: The response clearly and correctly provides the allele frequency, allele count, and allele number for rs745774658 in the Japanese population using a credible database (ToMMo).
	•	Completeness Score: 10/10
	•	Reason: All necessary information (allele frequency, count, number) is present, and the source is specified, covering the query fully.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 10/10
	•	Reason: The response is logically structured and consistent in presenting data without contradictions.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 9/10
	•	Reason: The answer is clear and concise, though slightly verbose in presenting individual data points (e.g., allele count could be summarized briefly).
	•	Evidence Support Score: 9/10
	•	Reason: The source cited (ToMMo) is reliable, but providing more details about how the data was obtained would strengthen the evidence support.
	•	Total Score: 48/50

	•	Answer GPT-4o
	•	Accuracy Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: The response does not directly provide the allele frequency but instead suggests databases where the information might be found. This fails to address the question accurately.
	•	Completeness Score: 6/10
	•	Reason: While the response lists multiple relevant databases, it does not provide any actual allele frequency data, leaving the question unanswered.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 8/10
	•	Reason: The response is logically consistent and provides reasonable suggestions, though it does not fulfill the user's request.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 9/10
	•	Reason: The answer is clear and well-organized but could be more concise by avoiding unnecessary explanations about database usage.
	•	Evidence Support Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: The response lacks direct evidence and only suggests databases without checking or citing specific data sources.
	•	Total Score: 33/50

	•	Answer VarChat
	•	Accuracy Score: 2/10
	•	Reason: The response does not address the initial query about allele frequency at all. Instead, it provides unrelated information on the clinical significance of a specific variant.
	•	Completeness Score: 2/10
	•	Reason: The answer completely omits allele frequency data and lacks any attempt to direct the user to relevant population-specific databases.
	•	Logical Consistency Score: 4/10
	•	Reason: The response is somewhat coherent but diverges into clinical and functional details unrelated to the question, leading to logical inconsistency.
	•	Clarity and Conciseness Score: 5/10
	•	Reason: The answer is verbose and introduces technical information unrelated to the question, reducing clarity and focus.
	•	Evidence Support Score: 7/10
	•	Reason: Some of the cited studies and references are credible, but they do not answer the user's specific question and are therefore not relevant.
	•	Total Score: 20/50
